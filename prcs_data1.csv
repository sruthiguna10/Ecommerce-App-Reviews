"this is way too much. there are 1000 verifications, wants all your life information, you need this and that just to sell on amazon. ebay or mercari simple, but amazon acts like you are working a government high profile job to simply have a seller profile. very annoying very unnecessary, many of the steps are repetitive and could and should easily be condensed down by half. terrible",1,3
suddenly the notifications has been disabled for my app on my samsung f23. causing lots of issue in processing orders and being updated,1,3
this is the worst website i've ever seen its like that intentionally made it difficult to list listings it's overly complicated they don't respond when you ask for help they don't respond to anything they just tell you i supervisor will have to call you back within four hours and they never do so you call back and i tell you the exact same thing then they try to make it like you can't cancel do not use amazon i'm really hoping temu destroys amazon because then they would get a taste of their own,1,3

worst application for selling. they mostly have cheaters as buyers. policies can be changed according to amazon anytime. win win situation for amazon beacause they dont give commission charged and will deduct amount from your amazon seller for reverse shipping. many users order products use it for 7-8 days and return that product after using and and amazon refunds the amount without inspecting. its not sellers hub its cheater buyers hub. amazon is going worst nowdays. they hv lots of fake cstmrs,1,3

"definitely not seller user friendly compared with shopee & lazada platforms. product listing and updates took ages and wasn't instantly posted. sellers need to go through too many unnecessary steps just to list a product for sale. and to make things complicated, amazon sellers share generic product listing, instead of having the option to post their own images and descriptions. amazon needs to study and look more detail into how its competitors (shopee & lazada) operate in the asia market.",1,3

"hm. there's a fine line when handling ad campaigns, while knowing the true value of your own product. when there's scarcity of a product in business, and i have a surplus, and my product is selling at the same capacity, with or without an ad campaign, it has to make a farmer wonder if the sales are being filtered due to an interest for fba on amazon's behalf, when in reality, my product going straight to fba would actually make my product perishable faster, and would render less gp% for me. hm.",3,2

"took a while getting used to it. not at all intuitive, menus are not really arranged logically but you can certainly do most everything that needs done without the webpage. i like being able to list my products from anywhere and i just think it could be so much better but the brain that developed this app doesn't have a real clue as to how the seller being a human being of any culture really thinks. does the job.",4,2

selling on amazon is a big headache with no profit. amazon spends millions on television advertising trying to convince the american public of what a great company it is... amazon screws at sellers into oblivion while its owner the richest man in the world gets to play around with his very own space program.,1,2

day by day you're forcing sellers to move out. amazon keeps on changing their policies that makes it more difficult to make profit. recently you guys are asking for packing video evidence for safe-t claims!! unpacking video of returns is acceptable but you expect us to record videos for all the orders we ship out and store it for months? that's ridiculous! if that's the case we sellers should also have option to demand for unpacking video from buyers before issuing any refunds from our account!,1,1

the app could be better. it could be more streamlined in the listing process and improve messaging. it is miles ahead of the archaic web back-office though where you still have to generate and submit spreadsheets for many things. they need to take a page from shopify. update: 10/25/2022 not sure if it's just the app but scanning items and trying to list items that i gained approval for is just looping back to request approval so i can't list them. i see no improvement in this app.,2,10
"app works fine, but amazon keeps telling me i need to update my credit card. they won't let me sell anything. i did update my card, so now it's this kafkaesque cycle of me updating my card and trying to list items, only to be told i need to update my credit card again. sigh.",1,10

this is a horrible platform to sell on. amazon accepts anything for returns so people can take your product and send back a rock or use it and send it back damaged and the refund is automatically taken from your account and given to the culprit. there is no way to speak to someone about your seller issues. everything is through email and takes months for replies at times. no wonder california has a big lawsuit against amazon over their practices. i suggest sell on anywhere else. amazon sucks!,1,9

"the app prevents certain people from signing up to be a seller. rejects perfectly good, legal, unexpired, government and active identification. i wonder how many people of color have been rejected without explaination? when you call to find out why your id is rejected they are glib, rude and unexplanatory, which is suspect behavior. is this a racial thing? ‚Äînative american would be seller.",1,7

it's funny how the hardworking sellers on this platform are being treated worst than animals on this platform. after chatting to customer support there is no option to give feedback or complain. they are being very disrespectful. closing the chat or sending you irrelevant links without showing any genuine care or effort for resolving our queries. today is 12th of july 2022 and at 16:47 london tz i have been trying resolve an issue about product description. spoken to tess from cs and three othe,1,7

"amazon provides the worst seller service i've ever encountered in my life. no app would be able to compensate for such a poor service. i am writing to provide feedback on an app and company that don't work for sellers, it is a scam with unclear fees and hidden expenses that end up eating all of the sellers margin, one way or the other. beware of this scam and don't try to sell anything through amazon. it sounds very official because it is amazon but it is a mess, they constantly loose products.",1,6

as a seller don't advise to sell on amazon because now a days amazon safe-t claims response is gone worst day by day for seller. seller bearing a lot losses due to their negligency only. claims are declined just fake statements like video not clear and all. even after sharing multiple time they repeat the same thing and totally doing fraud with seller. even nothing available where seller can escalate the things. beware! beware! beware! specially for new seller.,1,4

poor,1,4
"while this app used to be very user-friendly, unfortunately amazon has recently made a decision that many books require approval or are restricted from being sold. this has severely limited our ability to sell the books already in our inventory.",2,4

no way to disable cod orders if we are easy ship. no refund on shipping cost even after lot of rejected and undeliverable orders. further amazon initiates refunds at its will. there is no communication with the seller. utter monopoly and amazon using its market position to cheat sellers with unethical policies.,1,4
not able to manage fba shipment,2,4
"first review: customer order invoice should download in png, jpeg format rather than pdf. second review : finally i'm closing my account from amazon seller, due to high referral fee and bad amazon policy. i have updated few listing price and i got mail ""certain potentially erroneous pricing detected"" and amazon deactivated my listing. it's so horrible means we can't set price for our own product. so finally i'm stopping spending money on amazon seller",1,4

not sure they actually want individual sellers on their app. listed a collectible vintage book in the price range of others shown in the seller list and it was deactivated for pricing. tried to resolve the issue with seller support and it is non-existent. very disappointed,1,4
"doesn't notify you of sales, even with push notifications and all on. resulted in a few poor buyers, who paid, only to wait, and wait... entirely oblivious to the fact a book i forgot i listed over a year ago, finally sold... i feel terrible for those who made a purchase, and never even got a response back. i try to catch the emails, marked important of course, but the seller app should be alerting you the moment your item sells! but given the resources this app has, it'd be a 2.5 star.",2,4

amazon now a days has become really cheap and pathetic. have started a new trend of rejecting each and every safe-t claim of a seller with no reason and number of customer rejected orders are also increasing day by day. a new way of cheating sellers. just thinking for their benefit. introducing new rules and regulations on how he can cheat a seller and also earn from a buyer. win win situation from both sides. would not recommend anyone to join as a seller on amazon.,1,3
very complicated to understand normal person... deliberately design like this because of making business with side channels like support.,2,3
amazing,5,3
"the app is great, but amazon is being very strict for small businesses. we dont have our printer, but they mandated sticky labels for shipping, which is not possible right now, we need atleast a month to finance a printer and a desktop, which also we don't have. amazon should provide options for small businesses else how can we sell on amazon. already they say 2% fees, which is not, fee is more than that.",1,3
they discriminate if you don't have a cc no other options and carefull if your driver license says born in russian now they started to discriminate on that as well charged my d card but they won't open my account saying they don't know what the issue is.,1,3

worst app the seller support team is worst on this platform the buyer always do fraud with the company but they never ever treat their customers badly or take any action against them. the safety claim we apply gets denied by the team really do not indulge in amazon for business they are really disgusting never care about the seller even they are in india due to sellers but never ever thought about us. i am sure that jeff bezos will really pay one day for this and had to pack his belonging soon,1,2

app is good but amazon is not seller friendly. they are always on buyers side . therefore amazon is good for buying only . not good for sellers. even if customers cheating repeatly to sellers they don't do anything they just tell sellers to file safety claim which is always denied. even if seller know buy his experience that the buyer is fraud then also they have to send the product & bear so if you earn small-small amount in ten orders just 1 order of a cheater buyer make your profit zero .,1,2

the support team is lazy one always running away from their duties. rather than solving an issue they put you on hold & then disconnect the phone. moreover they would just copy paste some texts from their knowledgebase in reply to your query without looking into the actual problem and guess what the copy-paste given by them is also worthless. there is also no grievance dept where you could lodge complaint about this behaviour of the seller support executives.,1,1

won't let me upload documents. at one point during the sign up process it asks to upload the front and back of an identity document. every time i click on that it'll just tell me the requirements for the image.. doesn't act√∫a let me take any pictures.,1,1
if i could give 0 i would. have spent weeks getting postcards sent to my address and wasted 70 minutes for someone to verify me that that never came. my video call was disconnected and noone called or emailed. of course they were able to charge my account just fine last week.,1,1
easy n quick access to daily sales n payments data. good for communication from customers,5,1
"best app for sellers,",5,1
"from the 17 to the 25 of january 2022, my amazon seller account was temporarily locked. my credit card money is stuck in my amazon seller account for $26,000, and amazon seller support isn't helping me at all, despite the fact that there is no amazon seller support contact number. the only numbers that are listed on google are amazon retail support worst app i would say amazon need to check proper audit amazon twitter seller support customer support worst not responding anymore on twitter worst",1,1
app is broken i can't verify my identity every time i click button to upload make it so i can't click accept on the pop up,1,1
"worst!!!!!! i had received an order for a book, so i packed it & was shipped by amazon.... then it showed that it was rejected by the buyer.... i neither received the money nor got my book back...",1,1
excellent,5,1
confusing and needs improvement. still it is usefull,4,1
hangs a lot,3,1
very useful app ..it's easy to upload the product and checking orders,5,1
"easy to use, sometimes wish the app had more functions to edit listings etc.",5,1
"sell on amazon is not easy, amazon is force to add wrong details for listing, listing reject and force to add wrong details. third class service for seller account. shopee is more batter then this cheaper one.",1,1

no advertising section in mobile app and there's many features you can't get to without being on computer. wish it was more mobile friendly but you get other great info.,3,1
"after a couple weeks of going thru the sign up process, i can finally log in to the seller app. i am not able to access anything because a 2 step verification. when i click the button it just resets back to log in. was really looking forward to this app. amazon please contact me to resolve this issue.",1,1

warning amazon will automatically enlist you in the professional account in more than a dozen countries without your knowledge. then they will take hundreds of dollars from your bank to pay for all these accounts which have a monthly fee around $40 each. good luck talking to anyone because they will only allow you to contact them via email. they refused to refund the money i feel they stole so i closed my account. three days later they are still trying to charge my bank account for more fees.,1,1

selling on amazon is the most difficult online process i've experienced. the site is difficult to navigate and there is no support from amazon. there's no roadmap and again there's no one to talk to at amazon. customer support is horrendous and nonexistent. you are on your own even with this app. you must pray to god that he will help you succeed on this platform. it will indeed be a miracle when i do succeed with my products. it will have nothing to do with amazon and everything to do with god.,1,1

don't sell here platform is built to destroy your dream. be careful if you get suspended they will rob all your hard earned money and take it they will betray you,1,9
bad inventory management system but other thinks are cool,3,9
app glitches all the time for me. i'll request approval to sell a product and it'll tell me i'm approved. i'll hit continue and it'll tell me there was an error and take me back to the home screen. i'll go back into the product and it will not show me as approved. it's a never ending cycle on some items like that.,2,9
good app,5,9
works great. i typically use my computer to do anything in depth and make changes on my seller central. the app is very handy to check various points of information quickly when i'm not at home. user interface is easy to understand and so far i haven't run into any glitches.,5,9
"they have no staff for pickup of orders , we have loosed 3 order in a row and their seller service is worst in the world. they have no data no contacts . they are just wasting sellers efforts. do not register with amazon as a seller.",1,9

"nothing marries up inventory/sales. it is not very professional. i'm really shocked at just how poor the support is too. as others have said seller support about closing your ticket not helping you. products you list that were fine to sell just days later become unsellable. the app has all the headings you'd find on the website but most sections including refunds and customer messages don't work. only use really is scanning products, which is good.",1,9

i am a seller on amazon form last one year. i have been facing many issues regarding the return of orders worth rs. 7800. i have been following up with amazon seller support from mid july but there is no satisfactory response from them. please don't become a seller on amazon use flipkart instead at least they respond to you on every issue amazon doesn't bother even answering. i am really frustrated as they don't have any grievance hierarchy and i don't know what to do. beware of amazon scam.,1,9
this app is the reason i've decided not to become a seller. i can't even get past registration. i upload all items it asks for and i keep getting the unable to approve notice. tried it 4 times. im done. no thank you.,1,9

absolutely flipping shambolic.....i don't understand why you wouldn't allow permanent residents to sell in their country of residence. why would you charge a global fee of $39.99 per month .. and most importantly why can't i pick and call someone in seller support or chat with someone in seller support to understand more or clear my doubts.,1,9

can't stand it amazon makes money off us poor sellers. if you find an item and you put it on amazon amazon will find that item also and under price it so you have to lower yours down and make no money before you know it you made nothing on all your items. and you lose out on all your shipping costs. i don't know how you would make any money on amazon nowadays amazon is too big and it seems to be they are the only ones that make money off of your stuff. you're better off selling on facebook,1,9
its really amazing to use it.,5,9
"if i can give 0 for seller support i would. wake up new sellers! the seller support is not for the seller, they work for amzon which means as long as you clear out the support ticket and close it their work is done. i'd never seen such a bad support, but for buyers this could be a great things. don't ask don't care refund policy has been hurting sellers all over the state.ex.amazon would even give refund and just return itmes back to seller, customer has damaged the item..was returned refunded",1,9

good app to keep track of sales. there should be an option to view today's performance of ppc campaigns and ability to view sales of each item separately rather than all together (like sales tracker app) would be a huge plus. update: developers don't seem to listen. the app is basic and could be much better.,1,8

they invited me back after my account had be deactivated in 2017 for poor sellingperformance (i failed to ship 3 items). i verified my identity and they still won't reactivate my account. so completely difficult to get any answers. no attention for the small seller trying to get off the ground. so completely complicated and ridiculous so far. thats my experience. i'm a valued ebay seller.,1,7

amazon is trying to enhance the features on the mobile app inline with those available on the pc. the app does get stuck up at times. given the high number of users of this app it is a magnanimous effort by amazon. they might have to split the app in future to enhance functionality and ease of operations. long way to go!,3,7

worst experience ever if someone sale their products at amazon seller they'll be embezzled and if you sell something at amazon and consumer's will return the product that you sold then you'll get another cheap product that haven't you sold or you'll get the product on damaged condition and if you'll complaints against them then they'll reply that your case is closed because you didn't give us reply so please don't sell any product on amazon,1,7

im having the hardest time trying to start. i feel like they dont want me to open this store. i give them the info that they ask for and they keep saying they need it again. i already hate putting my personal info online this makes me worry about who is handling my personal info.,1,7
i'm a new seller on amazon having just joined to ready my acc for new products. since joining amazon have repeatedly and ruthlessly tryied to take money from my card to the point i've had to block the card with the bank and report it. customer service for sellers? even amazon themselves don't seem to know who these people are or how to contact them. it's all online and even to get a call back to amount of hours you have to put in is a joke. this is a stressful and difficult process!!!!,1,7

amazon is bad place for the sellers ! if you are new seller then you have to give whole supply chain of one brand to get approve from amazon to sell a particular brand product ! and amazon will suspend your account anytime and ask for various invoices and many other verification! so basically 5 to 6 seller is dominating amazon and other new sellers won't get chance to sell ! new sellers have to be verifiy so many documnets and supply chain ! so it is so disgusting !!!,1,3

i started campaign for advertising and they stopped ads for payment failure because amazon.in has only one option they will deduct money from seller account. i paid via neft it will take 7 working days to reflect. that means my product rank will again hamper due to low visibility other marketplace are better option. i asked shall i pay you in advance they say no. recently noticed amazon associates are talking very disrespectfully. i think jeff bezos want to close amazon.in unhappy sellerüòî,1,3

amazon use to be a good to place to sell. now they accept bad behavior as the normal. if you have a competitor amazon will allow them to buy your products and claim inauthentic. no problem as we have invoices but basically a selling platform for babies in a sandbox. they also will ask for information about products that you have no responsibility of providing. they may ask you what plastic you use to produce the product when you're only a secondary seller from an authorized distributor.,1,2

awkward to get started ok after. don't expect to get started without a huge ordeal and multiple messages to the help team. obviously the whole seller ideal is based on amazon making money which includes unnecessary repetitive actions to sell a product plus unclear instructions. couple this with a help team completely unable to actually call someone and you have dilemma. each issue i faced i over came by repeating get my actions choosing different options until it work. description is a joke,2,2

"been a seller for a month. had multiple incidents of order autocancelled because amazon will run short on manpower for easy ship pickup and they will just skip the pickup without notifying. resulting in not just sales loss but also charging you cancellation fees and reflecting that in seller metrics. they reimburse once request raised. but for the last two cancellations, they haven't resolved even after following up 4-5 times. hope they notice the feedback here and resolve my case üôè ""hope""",1,2

"difficult to understand the information they require i. e. entering isbn they should say they want min 10 characters and not to include spaces or hyphens. also entering categories not very clear, sometimes it seems as if nothing has happened when you save but found it was asking for another category. i am not exactly thick but this was confusing to use for me!",3,1

amazon seller is so bad kabse login karrahi hu ho hi nahi raha it's so bad,1,1
the app is funky at best. doesn't replace a laptop or desktop for flow or understanding or tasks. the app is not intuitive at all. it barely functions and never properly. cant access cases and most features without going to full site. still is flakey at best. i.e. if you are in vacation status. nothing has been done to improve this app. it is flakey at best and unfortunately unsupported by anyone. it is inadequate for any mobile usage. a perfect example of poor off shore coding,2,1

a little clunky and not great interface. viewing things like specific daily sales and orders etc is a bit cryptic. you just get a total figure totalling all sales but not which product you have sold. the app doesn't tell you fees you just have to wait and see. the app could be worse i guess but could be an awful lot better,3,1
very easy to use,5,1
a bit confusing and busy at times and some of the functions are account for doing the same things.,3,1

well i gave it a 2 would have been a 5 but not happen with some of the advertising like the early review program. i shipped all our beach chair sakes out in 1 day lead time with free shipping and the early review program only brought me in 1 review way is it that amazon doesn't send a email to the buyers in box. we have had no complaints or returns. we have had 60 plus sales and only 1 review. amazon has not helped with our early review program.,2,12

issues after android 11 update: please fix the camera from freezing and after taking photo and clicking the green check it closes the camera part of the app and goes back to the amazon seller app home screen - this is very annoying when taking multiple pictures of the same itemaas you have to click hamburger menu then the product photo studio again to take another photo. fix these issues then i will put to 5 stars - the only app i have used that actually work well with making a white background,2,11

it's ok. it's a little slow and clunky. for a snap shot of gross sales it's pretty good. but to alter or add a listing its not the most user friendly. newer features in listings to estimate profit it very useful. listing is low and painful on it. sometimes it doent load.,3,11

great app! it would be greater if bar chart is color coded for item sold and app has a chime notification for each item sold,4,10
doesn't work with bluetooth scanner. it just moves down to top sellers instead of entering upc code like it used to. worked fine for last 6 years then a couple of updates ago it stopped. disappointing. new update is even worse. now add coming up every 10 seconds asking me to rate the app. worse!!!!,1,10

sales ranking isn't accurate when scanning. it always show different after refresh. its doesn't stay current. this causes you to lose money especially after you ship books to fba only to find out 30 minutes later the rankings have plummeted and you are stuck with storage fees. plus they removed their listing showing up when you scan. now you have to into the listing to see if amazon has a listing.,3,10

"with some recent update, they stopped showing buyer messages that need a response unless i dig deep to search for them. kind of defeats the purpose of having the app, since we're required to respond to buyer messages within 24 hours. works well for most applications on the road. answers the question, ""should i buy this for resale?""",1,10

worst platform for seller. it deactivated my account 1 week of activation. it asked for tge invoice bills of some products. i provuded the bill with all the details asked but it didn't reactivate my account. i don't even know why my account is being deactivated and don't know what more information is required in the bill because the amazon seller support do not respond to my mails and call after deactivation. i was selling genuine products but still my account is deactivated.,1,9

i'm impressed! actually functions with the user in mind. the people behind this app should be the ones designing the main website. i've read some other reviews with less than favorable ratings and most of them seem to have the same theme: millennials wanting everything to be perfect and at their fingertips.,5,9
all i need on the go.,5,9
great app! you get an execellent overview of everything.,5,9

i am bit dissapointed with the app. i am an active seller on amazon. the only thing i find frustating is it's mobile app. whenever i make any change in the app it never reflect in the mobile app. also i have several times updated my pickup address but the same does not reflect or gets synced in the mobile app which in turn creates an issue while order processing. amazon needs to do something about the android based seller app. it should build a more good and flexible user interface.,3,9
okay,1,9

"-100 star. if you're small/ mid size seller, prepare to get butt hurt by big amazon. 1)you're small, your shipping contract suck, so no choice but to use amazon shipping or fba. then they'll loose your package and you can't claim it! try it and you will see. 2) seller performance team will eat your lunch. their sole purpose is to worship buyer and rap sellers. 3) when u r small, u can't handle large fraudulent returns. amazon says this is cost of business. no, it's rap the small guy period.",1,8

"it would be nice if there was full desktop functionality in this app, but works as advertised",4,8
used to work - profit and fees no longer added so unable to see if an item is worth either buying or selling. when scanning in products in and reviewing in inventory this can now take hours for the product to be seen therefore making shipping a task that can last days,1,8

amazon is a fraud partner. they charged 3x selling fees in a month from my credit card but not active my selling account. i can't contact through portal because they only allow to contact about account suspension related queries. i am very disappointed. amazon charged 9000 inr in a month and don't provide me any type service :(,1,8
extremely comfortable,5,8
good service,5,8
very good,5,8
it's almost impossible to create a listing. it's way difficult process. when someone try to list their product without gst. there is an option to ask for exemtion but after that again the product list already on amazon pop up. then there are few already restricted products. then they ask you to create a new listing. then again ask for the exemtion. then again product list . then again ask for the exemtion. then again product list ... this will continue till you loose your patience and leave it.,1,8

it's very frustrating. new buyers are at the bottom of the search list. my product is the cheapest but about 50 plus items down. the same item sold 500 in a month i sold 1 and only because i ran a advertising campaign. which cost extra. so far i'm losing money. update amazon seller will try to scree you every which way they can. customers return items that you didn't sell them but you still have to eat the cost. one customer bought 8 of the same item and return 8 random items and i got screwed.,1,7

thanks to amazon for good buissness,5,6
dont ever work with amazon . just frauding sellers . they even don't bother about your complaints but if some competitor purchase and give negative review they will block your account . after that you may receive calls from many dalaals for activating account and they will charge 8 to 10k from you . they all are fraud,1,6
the information you need the most is impossible to find... feedback and current balances including loan information. easier just to save the link to the full seller central site than to use this app. just not helpful at all.,2,6
initially i always wanted a market to sell my paintings and now i found this app to make my dream reality ... thanks to amazon sellers app..,5,6

"we are really very disappointed by the type of services you are providing to your sellers. our account is blocked just because you team was doubtful that we are selling product of different sellers. your team requested for documents like invoices, authentication letter etc. which were already shared by us but unfortunately our account is still blocked. we tried to contact you by emails/calls but we are not receiving any revert. over the call we wasted thousands of buck as it is an isd call for us but we never received a satisfactory revert. from past 12 days we are sending emails on ceo email but no revert from there also. this is something very pathetic, request you not to spoil the name of your company by doing such things to sellers. regards nz decor",1,6

no respond on seller support no matter how many calls or mails you drop,1,6
it never gives notification about the product order or any other notification. what is use of keeping it in my phone,1,6
very good app for managing orders and even inventory but it still lacks certain functionality that would make it 5* (some of which is also missing from the browser interface too). 1. print del notes direct from within the app 2. include a data field for product location 3. set default options for postage settings 4. display low listing confirmation on main inventory screen. 5. allow export of product listings for non business sellers.,3,6

its is ok for monitoring you seller account. but amazon is not a seller friendly place. it is hard to ever talk to someone with english as a first language. problems are rarely solved and if they are they are not in your favor.,3,6
excellent app!,5,6
the app is not the problem amazon's back end is the problem. sellers in the forums consistently complain about the inability to print shipping or to see money going through on sales to their account because the back end does not seem to keep up with transactions. the app does what you expect it to do,4,6

issue was worked on quickly.,5,5
great alternative to web page for mobile devices,5,5

great app,5,5
we should be able to add more inventory on mobile device,4,5
excellent!,5,5
works fine,4,5
easy to use. i do wish i could see customer feedback on the app.,4,5
nice,5,5
this amazing app for seller on amazon,5,5
its working so slowly üò©,1,5
good job,5,5
very helpful in running my business. use it constantly to stay updated.,5,5
can't find anything,3,5
"deactivated my account for ""being linked to another account"" supposedly!",1,5
"incomplete information for some tabs such as orders, refunds etc and does not include a sale notification .. overall satisfactory app.. but needs some work",4,5
"never accurate compared to the desktop seller central. waste of time searching for accuracy and refreshing to no avail. uninstalled, it's terrible on android samsung galaxy 10+ . completely useless.",1,5
so far good but some features are not available compare to browser.,4,5
cant even add credit card number,1,5
great app.,5,5
"amazon has the worst selling experience.. no customer support, no help, no english, speaking reps, nothing!!",1,5
app is so easy in use,4,5
this is best app you can update details from anywhere without pc and best platform of selling,5,5
very helpful and patient. best services .thanks,5,5
"garbage app. if you accidentally click on the wrong tab or select the wrong service plan, it's impossible to go back. i logged out and even uninstalled the app twice but still goes right back to the place it left off asking for money. the previous time i installed the app, it crashed everytime i tried to upload documents. amazon is amazing, but the amazon seller app has too many bugs",1,5
very confusing,3,5
nice,5,5
missing a few features but an absolute god send!,5,5
"good features, and provide good seller support. they can solve every query within 1or 2 hours. good support üëç",5,5
"not as user friendly as i might have hoped, and there are still things (like getting paid) that the app doesn't include.",3,5
push notifications? app does not send notifications to my phone.,2,5
very nice,5,5
muito funcional,5,4

make my life easier. great app.,5,4
amazon company is really good,5,4
great app,5,4
"great app to keep tabs on you amazon store! adjust prices, check inventory and sales, and contact customers with this app.",5,4
this app has gotten better over the past year. i basically use it to view sales and inventory and it does that well.,5,4
the app needs more work but is sufficient when you need to update pricing or check orders. i still need my desktop to properly run my amazon business properly.,4,4
great app üëç,4,4
it's really helpful but could use a better interface with looking at graph data,4,4
amazon seller's support team is horrible with their communications skills. they will suspend/deactivate your account for no apparent reason just so they won't have to pay you for the products you sold on their platform. also they will tell you to write an appeal letter to get your account reinstated/reactivated when in actuality their not going to review nor reinstate your account or release your funds at all. i truly feel amazon is racist enterprise when it comes to dealing with minorities,1,4
best seller app.,5,4
the only problem i have is when i am in usa store and scan barcode then i see it goes to my canadian store !,3,4
üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,5,4
good service,5,4
great app and getting better all the time. would love to be able to see how much of your campaigns budget is left at a glance.,5,4
"excellent app! allows me to respond immediately to customer inquires, keep them updated, and provide shipping information immediately for each order. this is a must-have app for anyone selling on amazon!",5,4
good app,5,4
works,5,4
tells me all i need to know while i'm away from my computer!,5,4
it'd be great if there is a photo upload feature in messages on android,4,4
can be very slow and scanner doesn't find a lot of older products. i end up having to type a lot of things in by hand.,2,4
good experience,5,4
slow app,3,4
our margin was too low and extra charges are high,3,4
great especially when out and about sourcing deals.,5,4
brilliant app,5,4
very useful.,5,4
"great app, helping a lot running business, easy access all clear, great.",5,4
this app has a lot's of issues for example there's a lag on the app i had no order then the numbers orders changed the next day which made me late in my shipping unreliable,1,4

again new order notification is not working,5,4
ok,3,4
accessing the business account is so easy on this app. instead of going through website it is very easy to access this app. it is also very easy to use,5,4
verry easy to navigate app,5,4
as per government rules we don't require gst for less than 20lack per annum sales. but still the app is asking me for gst which i don't have it. i am an online business starter.,1,4
i think about,5,4
"i can't see all the features on the first screen, some of the options are blocked",3,4
its good,5,4

its an good application to run the business,5,4
good,5,4
user friendly!,5,4
intuitive,4,4
good but not so good . flipkart is better than it for it's fast delivery and good packing protection,3,4
"excellent app. easy to use. but many disturbing limitations. would like to see the main image larger or spreadable, see all of the photos and the details. the entire listing in fact from the inventory and be able to revise them and the description on the app. maybe the entire listing can be accessed but i do not know how. also be able to access the listing all of it upon notification of a sale instead of one microscopic photo that can't be enlarged like every other normally on a smart phone.",5,4
good,5,4
limited functions. campaign data not updated real-time,4,4
it's great!!,5,4
reprsent,5,4
great snap shot of account activity. if product has barcode easy to list if amazon will let you sell products,5,4
good,5,4
it has been very easy to use can't fault it,5,4
the only thing i wish i could do in here is to be able to select multiple inventory at once and select an action. otherwise this has made adding products and selling so much easier! i love it!,4,4
love amazon,5,4
best app game ever.,5,4
it is a very good app for seller to sell any things .it should be easy to operate,5,4
app is good,3,4

good,5,4
nice,5,4
easy to use,5,4
good so far.,5,4
not updating sales,3,4
great but a bit of a glitch when switching between countries.,5,4
"its ok for day to day checks, but needs to bring the handmade functions up to par with those for standard sellers. for example being able to set up new products i still need to use my laptop. haply that i can edit products now though.",4,4
excelente para tener tu informaci√≥n en todo momento,5,4
app not give proper information. very bad for new seller. new seller sell smart. app not give proper information.,1,4
horrible,1,4

very well thought out,5,4
works,5,4
fast and accurate.,5,4
"easy to use for all your seller account needs. navigation is flawless throughout the menus, easy to update information and add new products! a must have if your doing business on amazon!!",5,4
it's very slow to load the up to date information also they are glitches when sending messages to buyers that say exceeds the amount of characters and which is not true also it's more complicated to navigate then the website.,2,4
slow working,1,4
this is obligatoy app for for amazon sellers but many functions of the app are not welldesigned.,3,4
too complicated,1,4
i love this app,5,4
very bad experience... i have my products in stock but it displays only one product in stock..,2,4
very good performance,5,4
it is a nice app. we get the solution to our problem immediately by calling in customer seller support.,5,4
too much information for sell................... complicated,1,4
ease of use,5,4
"having a lot of trouble opening my shop. i got charged 50$ monthly fees and then deactivated the next day. waiting 2 days for a reply that does not help me at all. now 7 days in, shop still deactivated and still waiting for help from amazon. you tell me",1,4
70% reduction in affiliate commission in a crucial time like pandemic is a very cheap move... this will be your first nail in the coffin,1,4
"come on guys, we seriously can't adjust our shipping prices unless we give you more of a cut? not everything in the world is $5 to ship. i personally stopped using this and jumped over to ebay. it depends on your situation but if amazon seller works for you, good on ya. i just prefer ebay for every aspect of their business. payment is instant and you can enter package details to charge exact calculated shipping dependant on locations. i personally won't be using this again.",2,4

very helpful.,4,4
worst company to see products with ever! if i could give a 0 star i would. i have never had so many issues with selling in my life. amazon does not send your packages properly many times and your products get broken when being shipped to your customers. then amazon charges the seller for amazon not packaging the item correctly and it braking! i have had numerous other issues as well but that would take all day to go over. very disappointed in this company for the service provided,1,4

amazon profits jeff bezos and a lucky few. he's a heartless greedy billionaire who is insatiable and doesn't care about anyone but himself.,1,4
"for some markets, all of a sudden, i cannot see the specific sku's sold.",4,4
"needs more. change app to run in background with notifications for fba and fbm sales and messages. sales on ebay give a cha-ching notification on every sale, this gives a useful sales velocity without having to refresh a web page. unable to determine actual amount of funds in account, the figure at the top is useless and seems incorrect. if it is not real-time, then is of no use. buy box percentage would be nice. lots to work on, so put down toon blast and keep coding chachagee.",3,4

"3/23/20 update:. amazon added new features, but broke those relied upon by me. recommended order quantities no longer show, as well as not being able to actually view competition as now the rating and reviewed of the first seller shown are carried to all sellers making comparison impossible. previous: constantly queries to refresh data when going from pages.. seems more susceptible to data interruptions from previous version resulting in being stuck on pages. tasks take longer now.",1,4

"it's been great being able to make cash on the side, and having great support from the amazon team.",5,4
"tr√®s bonne depuis le d√©but, et r√©cemment mise √† jour r√©guli√®rement, encore des ajustements √† faire mais l'application fonctionne vraiment tr√®s bien et il est tr√®s agr√©able d'avoir un suivi de m√†j efficaces.",5,4

lots if great tools to help you sell. i wish ebay would follow amazon and make an ebay seller app. thanks amazon for leading the way yet again.,5,4

ok,5,4
bad,1,4
"so many changes, that are positive!",5,4
best,5,4
"amazon seller is a big scam. on sellers risk amazon provides free return to customers and amazon takes cuts on both sale and return of order. big thief. why will seller be on amazon if all the risks is beared by the seller ? also if you succeed in selling, cloudtail will copy your inventory by white labeling it and sourcing directly from manufacturer. stay away from amazon. why jeff bezos became rich so fast ?",1,4
the app is very practical and effective. selling experience at the tip of the finger.,5,4
easy to work with.,5,4
good,5,4
"in the begining, the app was working fine. but now it has started showing errors: - the total feedback of all the competitors are appearing as same (in competitive price) - the sales history is set to show last 7 days. even if i change that to last 30 days, it again goes back to show last 7 days when i recheck the sales history - i cannot see any information in manage orders section in the app",3,4
the amazonseller website is more good then the app,1,4
good,5,4
it would be nice if we could see what product is sold when we see a sale. i realize we can see what sold 2 days later but not within minutes of the sale.,4,4
"issue after issue. problem with amazon properly receiving our inbound shipments. they've even lost some shipments then give us a hard time due to there error. seller support is no help. the dont even have a person you can talk to, they cancelled there phone number.",1,4

"it's a good app. i wish a few things were easier to access, such as messages & past information, over the 30 days. perhaps that is something i am doing wrong on my end. i use the app because the amazon website, even after many tries with seller support, will not show me my manage orders screen. so now when i sell a book i have to come into the app to get the sellers shipping info & then go back online and print the shipping label, very frustrating. the app overall alone does what it should!!!",4,3
very easy to work with. thanks,5,3
useless app don't sell on it,1,3

not a user friendly app.. keeps shutting when minimising on android phone.. while writing a msg keeps moving the screen and makes the ones eyes crazy following the fast moving display.. searching options are the most useless among all other apps,2,3
good app,4,3
excellent app... excellent opportunity... but to get success you need to know what you can sell fast and you have to make fast shipping and of course you should provide excellent customer service and the most important thing you need the good luck... god bless amazon,5,3
on point,5,3
nice app,5,3
good app.,4,3
im trying to learn more thank you,5,3

i wished that this app would give me text alerts when there is a sale and out of products,4,3
difficult and confusing when you receive multiple orders.gets funny when printing multiple orders from home.i just don't know which order is printed unless i open the order again and check.amazon should give more details on order page,3,3
"i'm to new to tell (when i first began). now, i notice (3 months later) account notifications are delayed, such as account health, payments etc. it would be great to know these things ahead of time so that actions can be taken sooner versus at the last minute. although there has been improvements with the app since my start and a great bit of progress this last month on it. i'm generally satisfied and at a major convenience with it. 9.25.19 app is performing better, updates stats are better.",4,3

very useful and easy to use,5,3
the app itself is designed pretty well. i would like to be able to see not only available funds but also funds on hold. i wish too that there was a way to see which items sold. my main problem is being gated in almost every category. you have to have invoices(receipts and packing slips dont work). i don't have any suppliers yet so i can barely cover the monthly fee with my ra sales. i think it's set to doom new sellers.,4,3
works beautifully!,5,3
insipire off bussyness good good greater app,5,3

"after 5 mins of use, a big window pops up asking for a review, you can't close it, you can't even agree to it, so basically it locks you out. the only way to continue using the app is to force close and restart. it's a great way to get negative reviews. hasn't happened in a long while. problem fixed. great app!",5,3

it should be little more easy to use .. little complicated i felt becoz for small small things i have to contact seller support.,4,3
great,5,3
application functionality is fairly decent and gets most things done that i need to do but what i cannot stand is the fact that there is no longer a live person that i can call and talk to for seller support and it's all through automated or chat forums or on messages and whatnot. i want to talk to a human being in real-time invoice like i used to be able to anytime i had issues with my seller account i guess it's just amazon the way of getting richer by having less people in call center,2,3

"the app is totally basic and provides nothing except a few stats. app should be developed in a way which can help one understand statistics in a better way. for example- can't you keep product value and units sold in one display instead of making us change it to other value every time we want to see. similarly order dispatched, pending and fba removal section is highly crude. inventory and price changing section is horrible",2,2
don't sell on amazon. first they allow you to sell other brand product after that they will suspend your account and demand to sent authorization sell letter to that product.very bad policy for seller. better to move on other online seller platform,1,2
addictive,5,2
"i wish the referral fee and delivery charge would be a bit less,, that would be blessing to sellers. otherwise app is perfect. amazon should bring back second hand books selling.",4,2

amazon has terrible seller support. it's impossible to talk to a human and the transparency is absent in actual fees you're paying to amazon. they shipped expired products to a customer that should have been pulled. they improperly package products (compressed face powder) that caused them to break and an excessive amount of returns.,1,2
great for scanning new products. and keeping up with sales.,5,2
"no one came to pick shipment after calling many times to amazon support and local pick up boy. they cancelled order and send a mail for charges. i have all the proofs that the fault was at amazon end. we deal in all kind of herbal and natural product like jatropha, pongamia, castor, neem their seeds, oil and cake. we also provide herbal product like safed musli, ashwagandha root, ashwagandha powder, malkangani, jamalgota etc.",1,2

"the app is useful only for keeping an eye on sales and orders. unless i am missing something, it is not possible to organise a shipment via this app. the inventory is rarely accurate but probably due to human error.",5,2

the most fake app in the world for selling. this app blocks your account within one month and also very bad returning condition. this app should be closed permanently.,1,2
they are thieves not giving seller money on time and making fool of sellers,1,2
"oh wow, that's a lot of information. there is a lot more information on this app than i thought there was, once i actually started exploring. i haven't tried creating fba shipments yet, and i don't think i will, but i feel like i can do just about everything else through the mobile app. i'm pretty happy with it.",5,2
limited functionality as compared to what you can do via web interface,2,2

amazon has certain rules which are not favorable to sellers and certain things are not proper or workable actually,2,2
"if new to selling on amazon, avoid this at all costs! just go to ebay, it's cheaper. no $40 a month +an outrageous 15% of your sales. ebay is typically a flat 10%. not only that, but several features on here are literally broken. i tried using my old account, nope. had to send a temp password to my email. never received it. tried resending multiple times. nothing. made a new account, and i get to my information and the birthday option is broken. whatever you put in, it will show up as invalid",1,2

"the app is good, but one thing they never tell you about amazon is if you don't make profit you still pay loads of fees including lost inventory, i bought 2000 units to sell on amazon my competitor claimed i used there picture and despite me sending evidence to amazon they have a robot replying with the same msg saying my listing is blocked until i provide evidence, so $2000 worth of units with amazon i cannot recover or sell plus amazon charged me $998 last week and took payment",2,2

"don't do business with amazon. any buyer can claim that they never received the package, despite tracking which said it was delivered, and amazon will back-charge you for the full price, including fees, so that you actually end up negative on the whole situation with no item. this is completely unfair, but they put lying, irresponsible customers first. seller beware.",1,1
user friendly..but many options are missing..can be improved,4,1

"good app to manage amazon seller store. you will still need to run your main store on a pc/mac , but for the mobile platform this let's you manage a lot of features such as sales, reviews, inventory, customer messages etc. if you are running multiple businesses and not in front of a computer all day this app keeps you in track with what's going on with your store. would recommend to anyone who is serious about thier amazon seller store.",5,1
i cannot understand why it refreshes and deleted my whole message to a customer!,1,1
"it is very glitchy every time i sign in it reloads the page automatically about 6 - 10 times before saying ""succesfully signed out"" then it repeats.",1,1
"the worst customer service in the history of ecommerce. it takes up to 12 hours to get a reply. and at that speed, you might expect some level of competence. think again! they will not actually read your problem and give you whatever cookie cutter answer that you most likely already found on their faq, which didn't help and is why you're asking in the first place. after days of back and forth, you'll feel like rating them one star too.",1,1
nice,5,1
very good app,5,1
"the search functionality had gotten progressively worse the last few months. it brings up so many irrelevant results. for example, i just did a search for ""uniracers"" which is a super nintendo game. my results came a bunch from a company called unirac and nothing for the direct result of uniracers. if i do the same search in the regular amazon app, the game is the first thing to come up. please fix this.",3,1

"the app has a serious shortcoming!! users cannot move between the app and the amazon website. users are forced to manually write down key information like the asin, then leave the app and access the amazon website. from there they must manually type in the information and perform a manual search for the product listing. this seems like an easy technical fix. still the same!",2,1

they cheated and misplaced my return items they didn't return it back and pathetic seller support service!! rude customer service staff. amazon is biased i am not buisness with them anymore there are other e commerce sites which are better,1,1
the best app i've ever used. never game me any issues so far. real time data integration. easy to use. loaded with functions.,5,1
i like the app. but just recently they changed a function in the pricing opportunities. i can no longer click through on the asin to check my stock or current buy box price. i probably won't be using the pricing opportunities anymore for this reason. you don't want to lower your price just because the app said so. check the current buy box price and quantities first before making any changes.,4,1
good work,5,1

worst experience with is app please don't use this for your business development,1,1

it makes uploading very easy when the item ia already listed. its a huge hassle if i need to make a new listing so i just dont. i always know what im getting paid and when. i do wish they would stream line inventory for those who sell over 200 items! has been crashing a lot recently however.,5,1
app crashes while trying to upload product image,1,1
easy to use.,5,1
too much supportive,5,1
this app starts out promising but 1/2 way thru adding my product it stops and says theres an error and its being fixed. i've had this over a month now and still no change. i entered my product thru the main sellers sight and that works well. please fix this app i really want to use it. if its not fixed soon i'm uninstalling.,3,1

not enough options to amend listings.,2,1
limited functionality. can't edit customizations. viewing orders are messy and can't view 'only unshipped' or 'only shipped' for example. there's no translation function and text can't be copied to use in other translation apps.,3,1
great app works well,5,1
good,5,1

there's so much to learn and can become overwhelming but in time you realize there's allot of potential,5,1
wonderful,5,1
"hi. i have not received buyer message notifications. the only time i know that i received a message is when i open the seller app. amazon recently implemented a policy where they want amazon sellers to not miss received messages within 24 hours at all. how's that going to be possible when we aren't receiving notifications on the app? please fix this. i am on an android phone and yes, i made sure that the notifications on my phone are turned on, same for the seller app. thank you.",5,12

very prompt.,5,12

amazon will take more money from the sale of your products than you will make from the sale of your own and they don't care if you know it or not because they have a significant amount of vendors that think amazon will help them make a profit but it's really amazon who will only make a profit,1,12

"very bad experience. only amazon taking advantage each & everything. like if customer return something then seller is the only person who will bare the loss no one else. amazon would always take there high commission and high easy shipping charges whether the product is broken, damages, lost part, amazon doesn't care. and if you filing safe-t claim then they would never provide full reimbursement even the product is usable or unusable. worst policy of safe-t claim. big loss of your busines",1,12

like the simplicity of the app to find the information i need.,5,12
notifications won't work. doesn't always scan the barcode when it acts like it does; you have to go back to the home screen and scan from there to get it working again. app also doesn't always tell you when you are not allowed on a listing. it's hood for a free app and a little help researching.,3,12

there are so many jealous competitors on amazo who order your product and refund it with no reason and by doing this they think that it will affect sellers which is somewhere true and amazon should take action regarding this . they should keep only exchange policy and should permanently remove redund policy . i think many sellers will be agree with me .,3,12

"1) support is completely useless. 2) as a professional seller you not only pay amz a fee for the sale of an item (15-30%), if a customer returns that same item you also pay a fee for the return (15%) +full refund from ur account - huge loss. 3) if you dont agree with amz and want to speak to a supervisor, you will get ignored, repeatedly. 4) if you complain too much they will compete with all your listings causing you to leave the site. 5) they block listings and change account settings secretly",1,12

never ever sell on amazon. you will end up with huge losses while amazon eats up your all profits. their shipping partners are so bad and careless that everyone one product out of three gets damaged and returned. be safe.,1,11

"3.8 stars: great app for what it does! rarely glitches and functions great! the visual product scanner on the camera is pretty on point. the biggest issue i have is that you can't filter the search results of the products you scan to filter by department/catagory, or sort by buybox price, or sales rank. that would be amazing if you could and it would make this a 5 stars app!",4,11

great app but it could use some product research functions like weekly & monthly sales statistics. and a filter function that would help sellers find profitable niches.. why depend on third party apps to get product research info when amazon could provide better info to sellers directly. it would actually benefit amazon to help sellers find and source products... just my $0.02 :-),4,10

amazon seller fees are high. amazon seller policy's for infractions are extremely overly unnecessary in the time they punish you for issues. there isnt anyway to call any customer service. amazon seller restrictions are out if hand as well. amazon seller wait time is also crazy long for payments. i do like being able to list quickly by scanning barcodes. the form for listing is quick and easy as well. i just wish they would make customer service for seller user friendly.,3,9

ups shipping is expensive bring back fedex. since amazon is not partnering with fedex anymore the shipping experience is one star. now we cant pay less. fba fees plus fba subscription must mean less money for shipping like we had with fedex. i will fix this rating when fedex comes back. i'm really upset as a seller shipping adds up and without discount from fedex i cannot longer send more shipments to the amazon's warehouse due to expensive ups. fix this. i would also like to see what sold!,1,8

the app is pretty good for existing inventory. when scanning though i wish it would show which skus were slow movers. you buy an item to sell and its only after you go to ship it gives you a warning. it would be great if it gave that warning on scan not after i made the purchase.,3,8
nice,5,8
"the app is functional, but i haven't been able to figure out how to transfer funds with the app which i find troublesome. another drawback is that the products seem to have to be edited individually instead of chart fashion like the web version. i like to stand in the warehouse and adjust quantities on the fly. i haven't figured out an efficient way to do that with the app.",3,8

works great happy i can use the app and don't need a computer to complete my shipments and update pricing. its improved over the years and keeps getting better. i also like i can request approvals for ungating products with app. also that it's free. there are some apps that charge a fee to show how many products sold and help more with rankings. i think that would be nice to integrate into the app.,4,8

really good app. has most of the functionality of the desktop site,4,8
this app quite useless as it shows wrong data(not updated) and there's not much you can do in it. the only thing i use it for is knowing the actual cost per click of my advertisements which is either not shown on the website or i don't know where to find it. amazon is probably the biggest company in the world but they don't seem to be too eager to help the sellers,2,8

it would be better if you have a total figure summary graph for all marketplaces then the option to drill down to each marketplace. also there should be an area for you to monitor product reviews given and also somewhere where you can link and view the front end listing. if these were added it would be perfect. thanks amazon development team!,4,7

"amazon sucks! customer service is terrible, you cannot have a conversation with anyone when problems arise with their platform. they treat their 3rd party sellers like absolute trash! as a general customer you'll hear back quickly, however, as a seller good luck with getting any response that isn't copy/ paste. sellers game amazon's system for reviews and they do nothing about it. they ask you to bring rogue sellers to their attention and then ignore it, even with specific examples.",1,6

customer service is horrible and they take no consideration for the time and experience of their sellers. dont bother getting into the amazon market. they are increasingly greedy on fees and nearly impossible to work with on customer service support issues. they suck. amazon will no longer be waht is is today in 10 years. mark my words unless they have a severe paradigm shift.,1,6

good for selling. wish we could dispute inaccurate ratings from buyers other than contacting them directly. amazon selling in general is great! except when they dont tell you to update tax information so my account was on hold without my knowledge for who knows how long! i use the app for everything so not going on the web browser version im missing out on alot of important features.,2,5
nice app but sometimes works very slow,3,5

dont waste your precious time to become a seller here on amazon.your account will be suspended anytime with a light issue and nobody can give you proper response after emails many time. if you are a started first time with few listnings and your account is suspended then its ok but if you are added more then 50 product listnings then think what will you got .your business plan will be totally vanishes .i am not become a seller in near future on amazon .try flipkart there customer care is awesome,1,5

not great in this day and age when 90% of the seller app can only be accessed via actual computer and not your phone or tablet! especially considering the very high fees. a truly mobile app that you could quickly and easily list items for sale from your phone and get access to your funds would be highly appreciated.,1,5

needs to be inproved. there has to be the order number linked with the all the messges or mail of the customers send to us. as we have to ask the customer about their product name which they have ordered and then assist them with their query . please update this so we dont have to log in to website again and again and the query can be resolved from the app itself with all the details of orders .,1,4

"couldnt ask for a simpler app, its faster than some of the 3rd party ones, and of course very accurate. they need to add some features tho, i wish i could filter out what sold vs inactive vs what is enroute, etc. . . please fix and or add them features. if you don't add at least one of those above in 7 days after this review, i am going to drop off a star next saturday. keep up the good work and make it so i can at least filter out sold vs inactive vs out of stock, ect. . .",5,4

was an incredible app the scanner and adding inventory is an awesome convient feature. however as of a month ago my inventory disappeared tho still shows up on the desktop and or mobile browser. otherwise still incredbile for its convienience,5,3
it's good but after trying out different apps i say amazon should merge their revenue calcutor with this app to help out sellers better determine which items are profitable. making updates to the product search by not having to put in exact word or rearranging words to find things. the product scaning option also needs an update it doesn't always work sometimes it does bring up other things.,4,3

great for a quick check but you still need to access the desktop version for some simple queries. for example you cannot see feedback which is so important for new sellers. a lot of work has gone into the built in product addition options such as photos etc. but they are no real substitute for desktop software. sales are monitored but totals disappear after midnight until being confirmed 2 days later. so unless you check at 11.59pm you have to rely on the bar chart. good but it could be great,3,3

"this app is great for the most part. however, unlike similar apps on other sites like ebay you can't click on the tracking number to see if your item is still in transit, etc. you have to find the shipping label, copy the tracking # on your computer/go to usps's website, etc. and the search feature to add a new product is often very frustrating. it often doesn't recognize the bar code & searching by the product's name doesn't always bring up the correct item so you have to email the helpdesk.",3,3

"i like the app but there are a couple of additions i would like... 1st in the fba shipments tab...it would be nice to have a tracking number once it has shipped, or take you to tracking info same as desktop seller central. next it would be nice to have a notification if something sells this could have a on/off option and maybe a certain sound. just to stop new seller's from having to check the phone every two seconds! thank you!

amazon seller app is not at all user friendly. so much things to understand. cant even post a single ad on my own.,2,2
amazon is not the right market place to sell your products if you sell a brand product and when the sales for such product is good they share those reports with couldtail india and they direct purchase from thr brand and shifts those products to fba warehouse.even amazon promotes those products which are sold by cloudtail india as they joint venture with them.now amazon has become most powerful e-commerce co. and threat to offline business and small online sellers.,1,2

needs to support amazon australia,1,2
"at first it gives you more sales, after a month amazon executive calls you and tells you benefits of joining prime, if you say no, then your account will be on hold & no orders will be given to u. recently i said no for prime membership, from then i got no orders. when i made a search for the same product anonymously on web, it showed me that this product is not deliverable to my pin code while the seller is from same pincode, even i use the easy ship from amazon. hate you for this",1,2
excellent,5,2
exleent good app but first time gion,5,2

not as robust as the desktop version app. i expect amazon provides real time data on sales analytics yet there is always a delay on the report.,1,2
"not dependable! app doesn't work properly at times, some seller fulfilled orders does not show in the app, i will only found out about these orders when i go in to seller central on the computer and sometimes they are already late. not dependable!!!",2,2

well designed and good function,5,2
this app is good,5,2
"can't list an item from app or browser, just won't let me proceed after adding description. not a very good app, must use desktop site if you actually want to do anything. pretty poor from one of the world's richest companies.",1,2
best seller app,5,2
very good app & convenient to use.,5,2
i wish you make the campaign data more useful by making it more real time. the delay is too long to have real time adjustment. i noticed now the campaign data is same as is available on desktop.,5,2
for a small retailer how does the gst is mandatory? give access through pan card. no proper assistance from your side to layman. and how do i sell self made products. no proper customer care support.,1,2

this app is the one app i use most and is by far my favorite app.,5,2
ghatiya selling site chutiyaa bnate hai ye log they have so high commisions and taxes but no account suspension or taxes for their own sellers they sell all products we cant sell anything they overtake all our listings wont recommend this fraud site for selling opening shop and starting chain is too good to ban and stop amazon in india soon everyone would stop selling online.,1,2
never sell on amazon they cheat their sellers they never care never respond everything they sell at 75%+ discount and you cant give more than 40% of same product they sell a-z and never let all sellers to sell. won't recommend this site so sell on shop but not online these are frauds activities done by amazon.,1,2
i would never recommend selling here as a small or medium seller their commisions are service taxes are too high + another 5 type of selling fees they earn easily they have big sellers of them you cant sell anything here because they are already selling at 70% lesser price of your price this is so frustrating never register as a seller here.,1,2
never sell ok amazon guys trust me they misuse your valuables after 1 day they will suspend every new account made their represntative called me and suspended my account after setting up their commisions are way higher thats why they are earning too much boycott amazon seller services.,1,2
amazon is a fraud scam website they fool their sellers first they open your account you keep costly stock but after few hours you get to know that you account has been suspended never sell on amazon they misuse your valuables.,1,2
not all functions are available like they are on the desktop version.,4,2

many of the features are not accessible with this app that are otherwise available on the website. for instant you cannot add pics of your product. once you minimise the app then you cannot access the app again. one has to restart the app all over again.,1,1

"the app is pretty good, the barcode search is handy but the general selling experience with amazon is pretty poor. i have been selling on amazon for a couple of years but as well as the excessively long waiting times for payments there are a host of issues. my last response from the seller support team took 11 weeks for them to refer me to an article that i had quoted as innefective in the original query (not for the first time). if they acted like you matter as a seller i would recommend.",2,1

uselss. first they said we will get payment in 7 days. when i sold a product they later said i will get payment after 15 days. even the product got delivered. then i can see amazon took a huge fee. i needed urgent money still i waited for 15days. when 15 days were over then i can see my balance.but still that didnt came to my account. i thought maybe i did some mistake. when i looked for help. training costs 1k. thats additional you have to pay. and still i havent got payment after 15 days.,1,1

it's very good platform to sell your product online. but when you get assisted by the authorities to add the product. its very hard to add new listing. you can only add product which is already selling on the site. if you want to add new listing you have to buy codes which i don't understand why? and then you can only add new listing on the platform. with the only help of authorities. thanks..,4,12

please make a app which is user friendly,2,12
only use this if you want your account suspended,1,12
was highly optimistic about fba having used them for years as a consumer. tried selling locally sourced mobile phone accessories on the platform after hundreds of dollars in amazon guided ads and a few manual keyword specific ads realized that amazon business seller was nothing more than a casino style slot machine where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. still love them as a consumer but switching to the more poor friendly ebay model for selling it was a life lesson thanks amazon,1,12

"the app is great you can do just about anything you need with it... three stars because the notification it is supposed to send when a sale goes through never works. since we are now a teeny-tiny seller, we get 1-3 sales a month, but i still have to check every day. our account is now ""in jeopardy"" due to late shipments for orders i didn't know we had.",3,12

"the app can give you basic information about your store, bit dirsnt give you all of the information or capabilities of amazon seller central. as a result, i'm often in the dark about what is happening in my store. for example, currently the app shows that i'm out of stock on 2 items that were shipped to amazon and should have arrived by now. the app also shows that the two items were received at amazon. but it doesn't tell me *why* i'm still out of stock. amazon seller central would give me that information. the app just doesn't have the same level of information that amazon seller central provides. still, it does provide some utility, most notably in showing a graph of sales for the current day and the past 7 days.",3,12

confusing and costs too much for someone just starting out with no experience. monthly fee would probably more than your initial profits.,1,12
nice,5,12
i'm not sure what amazon is trying to do...maybe pushout some sellers. many items i am selling...are approaching if not exceeding 50% fees of the item being sold. app is useless...a glance sure...but any detail and you need to go to a computer terminal for sure.,1,12

it would be nice to see the gear icon which allows you to go in to change viewing dates of transactions from 7 days and 30 days and such so it is visible whether it is horizontal or vertical view. would also be nice to go in to see the reports as opposed to having to open the webpage. i'm using this on a samsung tablet and it says that the app may not be optimized for my device... i would think that amazon would be able to do this. other than that... great :-),5,12

"amazon is not fair with its sellers. problem starts with sending the shipment to its fba center only. they don't take care of the packages.. people come on a bike with a bag to pick up a big sized box.. somehow they insert it it their bag.. doing future damage to your products. now comes buying..if buyer returns (very very lenient return policy, use it, damage it, return it)..huge loss for the seller..it doesn't affect amazon. anyone can write false review.. amazon will not remove..no matter how true you are. it will not listen.. only trust its buyers.",1,11

works fine for vacation mode but need more features,5,11
it's a rubbish app mostly as the app does not flag items that amazon have restricted you from sending in. you buy the item and the first you know amazon has restricted you from selling is when you try to ship the item in and it doesn't allow you to. it's a fundamental flaw that amazon doesn't care to fix,1,11

there was a dispute for infringement filed and although the email said the item was shown on the email it was not there and nowhere in the app was it listed or mentioned. my items were taken down and i was never alerted what specifically was disputed or why. just a vague notice a link to the policy page and no specific information.,2,11
"my experience with amazon seller has been miserable! the app is limited, and difficult to navigate. seller support doesnt even read the emails you send to them...they just robot an auto reply that has nothing to do with your issue until ten emails later (meaning ten days later). amazon has great customer support, but its a wonder that they have any sellers.",3,11

this best seller,5,11
the best feature is to be able to instantly allocate vacation settings. price resetting is difficult because product quality is not compared. you don't know reason for competitors low price.,5,11
my area pincode is said to be serviceable by amazon but the logistical associate denies pickup every time saying he doesn't service here.i got all my orders cancelled for not getting pickup.seller support says they're working on this but i see no results in about three months time.that's pretty much a time for directing the logistics to do a simple pickup.and the same persons number is messaged to me & he denies pickup every time.adding to the irony once they also faked a pickup showing item picked up and then it showed returned by buyer.pathetic.my problem isn't heard at all.,1,11
best app for managing the account of seller from mobile,5,11
good,5,11
not receiving sale order notifications even though they are set up! this is a major issue. disappointed in this app.,3,11

"wow... 2 years later and amazon still haven't added functionality to easily switch from eu marketplaces (such as uk and germany) to otherusa marketplaces. eve. though seller central lets you easily switch marketplace on desktop browser. with the app, i can only switch between eu marketplaces. if i want to see uk sales and then see usa sales, i need to log out and sign in again each time. rediculous! the app also doesn't show combined unit sales or combined profit across marketplaces. it's data is also slow and not real time, lagging behind when orders were actually placed.",2,11

"app is still pretty limited and stunted, as has low-volume selling on amazon become. the app's platform could be much more user-friendly. with amazon being the world's #1 online retailer, you'd think they'd hire a team of ""hot-shots"" to create a dynamic, state-of-the-art interface! but, although they continue to grow, rather than pass rewards on to sellers, our hands have become more and more tied (and not always for the benefit of consumers.)",3,11

"i think amazon has done an excellent job putting together their seller app. we get quick notifications, it's easy to print shipping labels, and getting paid is a breeze. i also like how the fees are taken directly with each transaction. (we've sold things on another site before and they wait and talky up your fees for the month and charge you separately. it was kind of a shock.) the only thing i found hard here was the process of listing things. if they weren't already in their system it's quite a process to add it.",5,11

it's a great app to make you successful as a professional seller with amazon.,5,10
it basically only gives you a graph of what you sold and a bit of info on what you have listed. you can't list/ship from the app. you really can't do much from the app and everything needs to be done from the website. honestly not worth the phone space especially since it doesn't even give notifications.,2,10
thanks amazon team,5,10

generally a good app to ck prices. the scanner is weak and you better verify a few things when you have a computer. i use this app alot but rarely make anyghing for sale until i verify the listing it links me to. you can't trust a bar code scan is accurate online. to check pricing...its great...if you cound just trust the item it matches was exactly the same you'd have 5 star app..if they upgrade the scanner.,3,10

"not really thrilled with this app. amazon charges a high percentage, higher than ebay or any other platform. but that is the power if mr. bezos i guess. the interface is frustrating, can't get all the information to show up on one screen like inventory etc, so end up having to take more steps to navigate to certain functions",2,10

the best notification sound in this entire world. i can hear it for entire day.,5,10
"this app contains too many shortcuts for things you'll never need. essentially, bloat ware for a sellers marketplace. things you do need are nowhere to be found. if and when you get close to what you're looking for, it provides a link that takes you to a place that gives you directions on how to find what you're looking for. why not just provide a link that takes me to it? better yet, why not just leave all of the high tech fancy options to professionals that require it, not force it down a beginners throat without any other options. i'm trying to sell items with part numbers. i know the price, i know my inventory. i don't need parcel derivatives or compounded freight modules. as bad as amazon blows, at least have a user friendly app. fix these problems and then get back to stealing from people and then lying about it. it's clearly what you scumbags at amazon are best at doing. steal, lie, hide.... amazon.",1,10

excellent access to key data used by sellers. try it!,5,10
"it's a good app for amazon sellers, though there are some things that can definitely be improved. it's a bit slow and clunky compared to other apps for sellers, but it's not bad for those starting out and is always good for checking your daily sales",4,10

wish it was easier to see monthly/weekly sales and customer reviews/ratings,3,10
the amazon seems pretty good,5,10
i like the app... just wish there were notifications like other apps. like when you make a sale...or when you get a review...or when you get a return....etc,4,10
a must have for any amazon seller. simple and easy to use instant notifications.,5,10
"app works pretty good. only wish it would show a restricted book right when it is scanned. also, if we use the scanner for isbn to many steps for sourcing books. needed to get another app. outside of that works great.",4,10
amazon always puts minimal effort into their sellers which is were they make most of their money. the app decides when to let me know i have sold items. it also never tells me when i have customer messages. and when amazon will actually close your account for late responses or late shipments you would think they would actually create an app that makes selling easier and more efficient for sellers. nope....,1,10
great app thank you,5,10
excellent. upgrade will make it + +.,5,10

"after 2 days of not being able to use my account, i called just a sec ago and was told once i paid it will take 48-72 to validate my payment. #amazon please work on what you advertise and what you train your staff to say and telling a customer takes 5-7 days to set up an account, but takes 2 minutes to sell on ebay.",1,10

great app to sell,5,9
not satisfied with it. doesn't provide basic information about your sales as far as when items are returned where your return merchandise is and when will it be restocked. the amount that you earn is often incorrect as it is not properly updated to reflect sales from weeks prior. valances do to you or not clearly stated even though you know that you've completed large sales transactions. example completed $102 worth of sales showing a balance due to me for a a single item at $65. needs a lot of work to do the basic things that a seller needs to be able to readily find.,3,9
"love the app. would be great to have a few more reports, but those will surely come in time...",5,9
captcha required to activate account. it doent work properly. amazon has to work on it,1,9

"its a pretty decent format. it does what it says. user friendly. i like that , i can price check real time. and is free!!",5,9

it is the best selling app i have ever vome across with. its payment system is also very good.,5,9
"this app is great when is working. it won't work half the time, some times even with a good signal or wifi ... i hope amazon fix whatever the issue, because it is an essential app and extremely helpful. update 9/23/2018 - app is more stable and won't crash as often. amazon has put a lot of effort to add more tools to assist. the app is very good, but it could be great: need a tool to add pictures for used products, need a spell checker and need more space to see what you are writing. it also needs a way to add tax to the offers and a better way to manage inventory among other improvements. it is a good start, but this tool can be a lot helpful because it is design to be be used in the phone and obviously is very convenient to use on the move.",4,9
"very useful, nice to have on-the-go. you can't do everything from here, but all of the absolute essentials are covered. a suggestion, though: if the fees can't be calculated because item info is missing, please let me enter that info from the app. 98% of the time i have the item literally in front of my face as i'm checking it in the app. it would help so much if you added that in.",4,9

great app. so close to being the full package. the ability to do more fba order tracking would be amazing,5,9
"easy to use app. i'm able to list my items on amazon in just a few mins. only down side is it may not work in low cell signal areas, but that's because i have sorry t-mobile service. the app help feature isn't too helpful",4,9

"editing previous review. advertisement really works. reporting format needs few upgrades like item wise breakup, category wise view etc.for easier billing. recent updates causing false notifications abt communications when there are none. also, there shud be an option to save settings for return and other communications. overall a good app. will be better if amazon.in can add features enabling direct chat between buyer and seller when an order is placed. this will help minimize order returns rate and inconvenience to buyers.",4,9

the ap makes it so much quicker to go to your orders ( the orders people place when buying something from u) compared to going into amazon directly.,5,9
"amazon is very poor service to seller no one can not work depending on amazon, once you build your business good of orders, spend money to advertise one time will shut down your store, if ask you send plan of action even you show invoice they will not accept your invoice, they are playing with seller's we do not have work depending work with this such of company, and any fake customer a to z guarantee claim, they will never support seller and they refund money to customers this benefits only customers and amazon seller's only the spend money to theme.",1,9
"i like the amazon app, however it does have some glitches on manage orders and communications and the sync on sold products is not the most accurate.",4,9
i use amazon and ebay selling apps. and i've notice amazon lacks push notifications which is highly important when selling online. so i would say ebay is the far better selling app. i get hundreds of emails a day so it is a pain in the butt to get notifications only through email.,4,9

"i'm a new seller on amazon and found their site pretty hard to navigate at first, getting slightly better, but still can't find the basic info like how much money did i earn on sales today. i downloaded this app so as i can deal with sales questions etc on the go, and it's brilliant not only do i get to view my orders, i am able to add products quickly and send emails and now i can quickly find my total sales for the day, it's very user friendly, there is still a couple of things the app can't do, but it does everything i need to run my business, i can even print my packing slips on the go and they are all printed for me coming home. i did read some neg reviews but honestly i find it so easy, and i am really happy with it, all my info and sales are notified to me and i can now easily find everything i want. brilliant app especially for a complete novice.",5,9

"in general, selling through amazon has not been a positive experience. the company does nothing to help it's sellers. a customer can claim an item is defective when it isn't and you have to issue the refund without any proof. then it looks bad on your account to have items returned. so it's a lose lose. i am deleting my account.",1,8

better,5,8
the app is good,5,8
user friendly aap,5,8
great free app for anybody trying to start selling on amazon. only downside is you need an active cellular or wifi connection if you're scanning items. so if you're in the back of a store with no reception you can't check anything.,5,8
too good...user friendly,5,8
good app to showcase your products and as its world famous so you can showcase to entire world.big plus,5,8

good app,4,8
"other than a few glitches here and there, this app is extremely useful for amazon sellers.",4,8
"there are small limitations but, it's a great app overall.",4,8
much less informative than amazon itself. stats are never accurate. use it more to check in orders. campaign manager is pretty useless.,3,8
"i find the app indispensable in working my sales, using it before listing, and after listing. as well as using it to list items. there is still a glitch or two, but nothing i can't work past. my sales would be much lower without this app. update: additional functionality has made it even more useful, and i have fewer glitch issues, though some remain. still an essential part of my amazon business. second update: additional functions - the ability to deal with suggestions from amazon about pricing as well as calculating fees even with changing the price to see how that will effect the profit point. as they add more, i use it more. still with some odd glitches and things that maybe should be done differently, but it is a work on progress.",4,8
i think this app serves the purpose very well. loving the new feature of manage inventory.,5,8
only wish i could see my sold products,3,8

"a warning to all the sellers. you will be better of selling on your own 
website than here. we had made commitment with fba with 100+ product 
quantity and we had shipped the same. now the id is suspended along with 
our products with fba. fba is now charging for the goods which are now 
being sold. so it's a viscous circle of loosing money and time. instead

by which they can loot your money. 1.) you will not receive your complete 
order ever. ( i ordered two v- gaurd stablizer received only one) ( i 
ordered one drill machine but received incomplete drill machine without 
bits) 2.) then if you will complain will give every proof i received only 
one. they will sympathise you for your situation for 5 to 6 days. and will 
say we will investigate. 3.) they will investigate by merely sitting in 
their office so called specialist team. 4.) will conclude ohhh sir we have 
sent you complete items its you have signed it on delivery paper. its your 
fault. ( because after opening and checking the parcel the delivery person 
will say talk to amazon people if you have received incomplete not my 
responsibility) 5.) amazon specialist team will say we can't generate any 
refund any return. 6.) oh sorry sir you have to return all the items 
whether you have received it or not. 7.) sir case closed your money lost. 
your product lost. you also get lost. because we dont give a damn about how 
much items you received it or not.",1,7

"displaying fee is incorrect and not given refund by amazon cheating us even 
after communication.",1,6
"this is a pretty awful app that is about as barebones as it gets in 
comparison to the regular website version of amazon seller. you literally 
can't do 90% of the things you want on here bc it just isn't there. this 
should not even be a launched app bc it feels like an alpha version. truly 
useless. edit: it's slowly gotten slightly better but many things are still 
missing and too many functions require you to just get forwarded to the 
regular amazon seller website, thus completely negating the reason for the 
existence of an app.",3,6
awesome easy to use,5,6
love amazon,5,6
really user friendly app for a new seller.,5,6

is small glitches from time time and delayed updates.",4,6

"first time using this app as i havent sold any items for a number of years. 
the app wasnt available then. added products, details, price etc easily 
enough but photo wise it falls flat. why can i not add my own photos. often 
i have already taken them. via the app it says out of focus and there is a 
noticable difference from the ones taken through the app (poor) as oppose 
to the camera (better quality). also very confusing when an item on 
inventory is pending as it just disappears and doesnt show anywhere. 
functional but not completely yet as srill have to go in desktop to access 
additional features.",3,6
"overall, the app has minimal purpose. you can view orders, communications, 
and limited data charts. you can not edit ads *so important*, or listings. 
you can not see pending orders details easily, and the design is not 
intuitive for sellers. i would rate this app 5 star, when they add more 
features. for now the app is good for having quick insights about your 
daily sales, and you will end up going to your computer for any actual 
work. update: amazon added more features to edit products, so price, 
pictures, description and even advertising! it all can now be changed from 
the app. my 2 star is now a 4star. amazon seller app is getting better, but 
not ideal yet.",2,6
just can't do anything with it. selling hope basically,1,6

to see below small yet useful features that will make sellers more happy 1. 
customer repeat order count as shown in desktop version 2. month over month 
sales view, which will be helpful for sellers to compare previous month 
sales with current month 3. in unshipped orders, if amazon can summaries 
units per sku id, that will be great. as a seller we always get these 
counts manually. this can be added to desktop version also. 4. ability to 
scan the shipping label and pull the order details. can be integrated as 
part of manage orders search bar.",5,6

a manufacturer that it must just be designed for resellers who don't make

""one size must fit all"" so others find it useful.",1,6

computer that's different.",3,6
user friendly,5,6
"amazon is cheating seller.. making money from them and not give their money

for shipping numbers.",2,6
everything i need 4 selling.,5,6

very helpful when away from a laptop,5,5
"it's a good app, but amazon being as large as they are need to move away

"easy to use, free, makes me money. i use it daily",5,4
for all new sellers don't trust amazon they are the biggest cheaters they will keep on charging fee for no reason on sellers this is  my own experience .,1,4

excellent,5,4
"the app is ok it does show you and send notices when you receive an order.    would be nice to be able to change the tone on the notice.   but has very limited use as no access to ad campaigns,  there is no notice of fba sales or orders on the app.  would be great if showed both fba and fbm orders so sellers can get a complete picture of their sales.  communications with customers is ok but could be improved.  over all it app is not bad, but if looking to see all aspects of your amazon business while mobile it is far from complete.   hope they continue to improve and add more features for sellers.",3,4
it would be awesome to include ppc management in the app but this works great!,4,4
good and very useable. need some more features though,4,3
best ever,5,3

very useful,5,3
ÿπÿßŸÑ€å,5,3
good app to stratify.,5,3
excellent,5,3
its great app for selling  only one problem is related to charges it's highest which creates product price as compared to market like closing charges which reduces margen of both customer and seller . must reduce to extra charges so that each customer can vesit site and ready to purchase at lower cost as compared to market and more product is cancelled after receiving order and it's take shipping charges and then says connect with customers you are middle person they are responsible that customer not cancellation of products,1,3

not understand app . not user friendly,1,3
limited. i never received notifications of messages from customers or orders. there are limitations on the return options and many functions are restricted. the seller support is far from supportive. not the best app at all. i give no credit to the most of the good reviews as we all know how fast people use to grade an appa without even using it.,1,3
nice app,5,3
for emergency it's really good to use,4,3
if only you could enable banking services in kenya,2,3

amazing app for amazon seller.,5,3
clunky. not intuitive. would like a basic push notification when i get an fba order.,2,3

great app. communication manager on mobile could improve  by showing responses to customer inquiries by other authorized account sellers on their mobile app,5,3
i wish i could manage my ads on the go,4,3
"well for new seller, its v convenient.",5,3
"great app! easy to use and extremely helpful. all of a sudden my barcode scanner is no longer available, not sure what that's about.",4,3

good for monitoring sales and replying to buyer messages while you're on the go.  when will this app support the australia marketplace?,4,3
"great tool when it is updated, not so much when it is behind on updating.",5,3
its perfect for what i want to do. it helps me add new products and make sales and fulfill my sales. quick and straight to the point. all i need is to know how many sales ive made and how to fulfill them. i receive all notifications for my sales. it seems though fba sales dont have notifications. oh maybe its an update error on mine ?,5,3

nice platform,3,3
my product is not shown in amazon app,2,3
very helpful,5,3
"app is limited in functions and needlessly complicates the order review process. it's as if amazon looked at its competition and said ""you know what we need to do?! make everything just as complicated as other people do because our website is too easy to use.""",3,3
"this app has made my life easier, all info in one place and you don't even need to type the name of the product! very time saving!",5,3
i like app,4,3
can't see proper payments details,2,3
good & time saving app,4,3

great product recognition software but no notification of what the error causing your ad to fail to post led to several hours of frustration.,4,3
nyc app,5,3
great app very quick and responsive,5,3
really bad app and platform the app is only hiding how rubbish the selling site is. i spent 6 hours trying to list 1 item and still have to say not managed it site keeps saying card not recognised. i tryed 3 different cards to get nowhere then when you try and get help this then takes ages as you have to go via top suggestions that have nothing to do with the problems you have.  for the 28-33% they charge in fees it's really not worth the stress they make paypal charge 4% and 100x easier but paypal steal money once you have funds in your account by limiting and not accepting i.d.,1,3
i hope amazon provide us business,5,3

amazon provide best seller service,5,3
"i think the new interface is much better. i really like the layout.   i do wish that amazon would change  the app so it was easier to check and change my pricing of each item. the way it is set up now, i have the go into each item to check or change pricing. it would be much better if i could go down the list all at once like when i'm on the full site. i try to stay competitive on pricing,  so i check and change them constantly.  and if i'm competitive then so is amazon.",5,3
best app ever,5,3

"does anyone know how to get top widget back to show my sale of the day? for some reason, it is hidden somehow and i don't know how to get it back.",5,3
why would you remove the product sales and total $ per day at the top of the app???? this was such a core feature and now it just has a bar graph which is hard to decipher!,1,3

"i wish it would let me know immediately if an item is restricted.  i'm new at this and i've bought a few things that i didn't realize i couldn't sell on fba, and now have to mess with ebay to sell it.  so now every product i have to check for price and sales rank and then initiate a sell only to find out it's restricted.  if it's restricted, that's the first thing i need to know.  since this is the sellers app, there's no reason to make this a backwards, rollercoaster of a process.",4,2

"honestly, just upset that going to the desktop website is far more informative and provides information on your account such as sales data that the phone app doesnt provide. id rather go to the website on my phone. for listing things, however, this app works great.",3,2
does it's job under even poor conditions,4,2
i frequently have to go to the full site to do basic actions,3,2
"the problem with the app is the way the ""add a product"" portion works.   as a retailer, i am constantly meeting with new suppliers, attending various trade shows, and i am presented with ""potential new products"" constantly. when i scan the product to see if it has reviews, popularity, what the current price is, etc.   90% of the time i scan a product, all i see is...   ""sorry we did not find a product on amazon for this scan. please try again or create a new product"".  when these exact same products are entered in ""add a product"" on the full desktop seller central, the product will be pictured, showing no sellers, reviews, product rank, etc.  why?  most sellers don't have the ability, or desire to carry their computer with them to all of these events, and type in each item one by one. why is the search result different for the app than it is for the desktop site?  i have passed on countless products  and deals simply because i had no idea what the rank, feedback, etc. was  because no information pulled up when i scanned them.   this means i have less products to offer amazon's customers. so amazon has more products out of stock, and more customers shopping elsewhere.  i am just one humble retailer. i know my sales are but a drop in the ocean to amazon's volume, but multiply the opportunities lost from me, times as many retailers you have using your app and you have countless lost revenue.   i don't understand why the app does this. i have used the app for years, and i know this was not always the case. items would still pull up on the app, even if they were out of stock. that is the main reason i would sell those items.   this is a big handicap each seller has that uses their smartphones while on-the-go.   the sooner this problem is fixed, the sooner business will increase for all of us",4,2
"does everything i require of it. order tracking, inventory control and most importantly communication with customers.",5,2

good app,5,2
i only use it to monitor the performance of our business and for that reason it gives me all the basic info required... my only recommendation is that i would like to know the overview unit products sold on the day and previous day rather than waiting for day 3,5,2
you should add the capability to start sales and promotions otherwise it works well.,4,2

very complicated app. waste of time.,1,12
"it's so convenient that i have shifted over to app for all daily routine jobs. well done amazon, you are no doubt the leader.",5,12
"pros - easy to use and doesn't ask for much info. great for 3rd party sellers and people with individual plans.  cons - not enough info about sales. customer service took forever to email me back. fees are kind of high. you have to know the products upc, asin, isbn, ean, etc... this requires research which may take to long. you can always create your own. they have a long restriction list of what you can/can't sell. some things you can't sell because it seems they or the manufacturer wants the sale so they don't let you sell the item. i could not sell a ge cable wires that were unpacked from a few years ago. some items you can not sell until you have been a seller for a few months with positive account health. for example, nintendo ds games.",4,12

nice. but need to improve more,3,12
the biggest issue with this app is that i use amazon ppc advertising and cannot manage my ads within the seller app. their website is not mobile friendly either for these advertisements so i cannot check on my ads performance or make adjustments on the go at all without a computer.,1,12

lovely complicated,5,12
it's great for keeping track but very limited in terms of functionality,3,12
it ok to just keep tabs on your inventory/orders on the go but some features like add a product and inventory pages could be better. does not scroll smoothly and freezes the page after each swipe for what feels like an eternity (actually ~15-20 seconds). if it freezes for longer i find it eadier to close and reopen. its not the best like other az products. very annoying.,3,12

exclusive,5,12
very useful for immediate acknowledges,5,12
most things are easy to do...then there are those things that take alot of time to figure out,3,12
the fact that we need so much information just to get approval to sell so many products is uncalled for especially if it's a product that you already sold 15 times now you need approval to sell. the customer service was horrible because not only did i have a hard time understanding because majority of the people are middle eastern but it seem like i got no help at all and they telling me the same thing over and over again. i wish there was another way.. genuinely i love the app but definitely some changes need to be needed other than that it is a great app i enjoyed the chime that gets out every time you get a sale and the interface is user-friendly,4,12
(1) very very complicated. does not encourage a new / novice seller.. not as simple as projected. (2) app is not 100%. some features have to be used only on the website. (3) amazon fee is too high. ultimately makes the cost higher for the customer. amazon should reduce charges and fees and shud make the app user friendly.,2,12
good,4,12
awesome,5,12
very grateful for this app!,5,12
great tool to find products to sell online.,4,12

web site is much better then this app.,2,12
"the new updates screwed everything up. it stops loading search results after i use the app for a while and i have to restart my phone in order for the results to load. sometimes they work for a while other times i got to restart again right away. this is super frustrating. how am i supposed to scan through 100s of items in a decent amount of time with a major problem like this. it was working fine a month or two ago. why cant they just leave well enough alone. this new visual scanning thing is a mess.  they fixed it but everytime i wanna confirm a order, i have to go to home screen instead of staying.in orders. very annoying . otherwise good app. now amazon and their mass suspensions off sellers for minor infractions: that's another story.",4,12
good stuff,5,12
"needs to have a way to record item cost as i list new items. also, need to have a way i can see total fees fba included, so that i may make peace of mind pricing decisions",4,12

all information at one palace about seller account,5,12
goodjob,5,12
great app. user friendly,5,12
a lot of room for improvement but it's a decent app,3,12
if you're an individual seller run and run fast their charges are not designed to be helpful or friendly for someone who's not mass-marketing or mass selling,2,12
good to manage inventory and check sales on the move,4,12
it's awesome app,5,12

"i use this app to monitor my online book business. it is indispensable to me in this regard. i do not use this app to list books (i find it easier to use the website for this), so i cannot rate the usefulness of that feature. i sometimes use it to view my inventory, but the app does not have an easy way to navigate my dozens of pages of listings like the website does. also, since the latest update, the push notifications have not been working for me. this is a huge problem considering i rely on this feature. i will add a star to my review when this is fixed.",3,11

quick way to keep up on sales activity.,5,10
great app for on the go management of amazon account.,5,10
i am also used as a seller,5,10
awful! trying to find something you need to use is difficult or not available compared to the desk top version.,1,10
it's okay.,4,10
the upgraded version doesn't go to a page with access to the scan function.  that's really the start for most other functions from a smartphone,3,10
excellent app. very responsive . needs to add some features of desktop for sellers and make it easier to check details,5,10

"i have scanned many items before purchasing, listed them, shipped them to amazon for fba, had them active then all of a sudden the products are in fixed stranded inventory and the only option i have is to create removal order and have them shipped back to me!  this has happened quite a few times but other than this, the app is great and easy.",3,10

"i listed something incorrectly on my first go at it, i tried to edit the info and i couldn't. i even called seller support and they said they had changed my listing but it is still saying the wrong thing. i should've been able to change everything about my listing through the app like it said i would. other than that i think it's pretty easy to list something that is already being sold on amazon....through the app anyway.",4,10
shi**y as hell seller support....ats damages the product and then steers clear when its time to take responsibility,1,10
good,4,10
truly excellent  app. it can be used to do everything  the browser does and has ways to see what prices are across all formats of the product being listed. there is also an option to see a customers order on the regular amazon page if you also want to look up the amazon home page see your feedback numbers and to sell something else and share the upload on social media. sharing to social media is a feature the app doesn't have.,5,10
seller panel,5,10
i had just started using it not seen all tge features but whatever seen is really convenient and gets updated soon,5,10

"there are multiple issues with this app. sales ranks not linked to the appropriate subcategory. app indicates that i can sell a product only to have amazon block the listing when it arrives to fba. in the latest update, i often can't scroll on pages. they get stuck all the time and i can't move them.",2,10

"it is amazing app and very helpful easy to use, very helpful your business growing",5,10
what an easy way to earn money by easily uploading product details. love you amazon,5,10
"it would be ideal if we could have more lockdown so that the scanner would only work without having to password. as sellers we have other people who provide us with items to sell but we don't want them to have access to the whole account (e.g. manage inventory,  orders, etc.)",3,10
better than it used to be but still room for improvement.,4,10
this app is perfect for quick management and updates i probably spend way too much of my day checking it!,5,10
excellent app that makes managing my products and sales a breeze.,5,10
love the usability.,5,10
i still have to go to web browser to see everything.,2,10

"trying to sell with amazon was terrible. after i up loaded all my droppshiping products they shutdown my account, then wouldnt even refund my money even though it had shut down before i could even use it. i called twice the agents to me they would refund the funds back to my carf in 3-7 business days. today i called and she said they wouldn't refund my money for 90 days. i asked to speak with a supervisor because she told me i was getting charged for a month from august 6th through september 6th which was a lie because i opened the professional sellar account on august 31st. she said the supervisor was not available and i told her i will wait she said you can't do that. stay away from this company.",1,9

"9/2017 update: after continuing to use the amazon seller app i just wanted to add some updates on my opinion of its functionality: if trying to manage inventory via this app, it is nearly impossible albeit, the amazon seller inventory management process is not all that intuitive to begin with - the app does not help.  original review:  this app helps to quickly and conveniently keep track of orders, shipments and inventory.  looking forward to trying out the new product photo updates.  only wish there was a text notification you could set for newly placed orders (if there is one already it is not apparent).",3,9
third class,1,9

"i wish is was more in-depth. but it is plenty sufficient for quick, commonly used aspects. never had any crashes, either.",4,8

waste of money. join ebay if you want a profit. too many hidden fees. no wonder amazon is big. they pocket everything including your profit,1,8
"useless. cannot even add new item which are not already in amazon. cannot review the item that i listed. that means it cannot be seen how my listing look like as a customer. even in the browser, listing product system is very hopeless. ebay system is far more reliable.",1,8

thank you amazon,4,7
"it's an okay app it works in a lot of areas, one area that needs improvement is the communication between buyers and sellers the app will prevent you from sending a message if you have (too many characters) from several messages between buyer and seller, instead of automatically adjusting like it does in the ebay sellers app.",2,7

you can manage your inventory and do quick checks on orders. pretty much everything else just makes you open chrome and log into the website. it's honestly faster to just go to the website in the first place.,3,7
many options are missing compared to logging into desktop. because many of us are monitoring through mobile and it will be very easy if we could make any changes through mobile itself.,3,7

"latest version: works well. many useful improvements. scanner is quicker, but still not as quick as others. first screen after a scan does not always show restrictions, nor correct prices. must click thru for accurate info. previous version: horrible. crashes on initial attempt to open every time.   when it does open, it never finishes crunching numbers. sometimes cannot get beyond that screen.    worst of all the scanner is now painfully slow in recognizing a code. scoutify recognizes codes before i've finlshed aiming the phone. get with it.  this is a business tool used on the road to enable us to make quick discrete decisions. i'm not looking for pretty interface. just the facts.  when will be able to sync to a laser scanner like profit bandit? this is a mobile app. help us to get more done. this one slows us down.  for older version:many helpful features to  keep abreast of business while on road. but missing some vital info when using it to make buying decisions. still need to use additional apps to get complete picture.",5,7

amazon is wonderful business i like amazon,5,6
"it has improved a lot in the past year, still clunky and lacks features that the main web page hae.",4,6
i have a suggestion... can units snd dollars sold be on the same page next to each other?,4,6
"it doesn't let me use it and says that i need to connect to internet when i'm in. we'll, this week it has been awful and it doesn't work at all. also, you need to stay with the same picture that is in the amazon and can't change it. some pictures are awful. so, if you want a better picture you can't do it cause amazon doesn't let you change it. well, i asked myself why my  product doesn't sell, here is the answer.",2,6
great.  do your research before simple questions arise.,4,6
"great app, user-friendly, efficient",5,6
overall the app is a 4 could be higher if when uploading new products as a sales tax option that is not available through this app. the visial scan works like a charm vs scanning barcodes.,4,6

i llike it,5,6
required lots of work to made it seller friendly.,3,6
getting better with every update,5,6
"finally recd all pay owed to me. cautious. trying to make sure i follow to the letter but have not made but one new sale and hesitate to sell any big ticket items. unfortunately, there is no means to rate customers. and amazon makes it quite easy for a customer to have a complaint and initiate refund that ends up costing small sellers too much.",4,6
awesome app,5,6
good,5,6
very helpful app. allows for quicker response times.,5,6
very easy and useful...,5,6
not all features similar to web interface but very easy to manage account.,5,6

easy to use,5,6
nice,5,6
"listings cannot be modified entirely through the app.  it would be great if the listings could be entirely modified. it is necessary to add an interactive link to advertise our listings on amazon.  it is helpful, but needs some improvements",3,6
awesome!,5,6
the best app for our business.,5,6
"it works well. however, it would be nice to be able to see your scan history on a pc. if you scan many items, it gets difficult to review on a phone.",4,6
amazon has been mass terminating accounts due to too much inventory being sent to fulfilment centres. i didn't know amazon would take such extreme action to keep control.,1,6
app makes tracking inventory and sales easy.,5,6
all the ads are missing cant handle ads on the app,3,6
good.  gives a quick overview of sales and accounts.,5,6
great app love it!,5,6

glitchy at times and crashes sometimes on the note 5. otherwise a solid app.,4,6
"can't get this thing to work anymore on my new-ish android phone (running 7.x). worked for a couple of weeks then stopped sending push notices, now won't even show any of my inventory nor any sales i make, shows me having no inventory for sale, even though my items are showing up online. have had several buyers cancel their orders, and the email i got notifying me of such was the first i even heard of getting any order in the first place.   seller support has been absolutely useless, utterly worthless, they denied there was even any problem at all for weeks, then admitted they were having ""server issues"" (??), still giving me useless advice:  ""downgrade to previous version (i already had) and turn on push notifications (they've been enabled since i first installed the app)"".   can't believe a company as large as amazon can't make an android app that even works at a basic level! pure garbage, caveat vendor!",2,6
easy as apple pie,5,6
this is the only app that i use for sourcing products. it works great for my needs.,5,6
easy to use,5,6
it has made listing fast and efficient.,5,6
nice &helpful aap! new seller & hope it helps me to increase my sell.,5,6
other than having to restart so sometimes to refresh it is a great tool,4,6
great app in the absence of a computer browser.  almost all the same functionality.,5,6
great with good wi-fi,5,6
good app,4,6
"the app is ok.  but there are a lot of glitches that need to be fixed.  i've had many error messages.  this morning it said no internet access, but i most definitely did have internet access.  i had to go to the desktop version to manage my inventory, which defeats the entire purpose of having the app.",3,6
the best business app yet,5,6
i love this aap very much,5,6
it's good app,4,6
great snapshot of all business activity. short and long term projection i love it and i use it daily.,5,6

excelente,5,6
awful lot of info available with this app. still sorting it all out!,5,6
great app to support sellar ...,5,6
excellent app,5,6
easy to use,4,6
"the app is easy to use but lacking in order information. to find out what sells you must go through the orders, sift through an out of order list, then click just to see a picture of the sold item (when you have similar listings in a variety of colors this is a huge pain). there is also no picture when you print the order so you must go through the same steps prior to shipping as well.",4,6
the app is good.  it will be better if you can see the amazon charges as well,4,6
working properly,5,6
it's a good app. i use it more to analyse my work load for the day,4,6
"this is a very good app. i utilize it in all aspects of my new business - from scanning potential products to loading those items into my fba inventory. it serves we'll in both those capacities.  i do have one thing that keeps this app from being a five - the visual scan part of the tool is inconsistent. i use it once or twice, then ""visual control is not available on this device"". scan one bar code, it reads it and then it's back. fix this issue, and you're a solid five.",4,6
excellent,5,6
amazing app. very user friendly. loved it.,5,6
would like to see the barcode scanner easily accessible.,5,6
great design...easy access to what u need,5,6
"great app, awesome customer service. 5 stars :))",5,6
pretty good. does what the amazon seller website does plus scans barcodes.,5,6
"i can't really say anything negative towards the seller app or amazon in general. if you're trying to sell online, this is the app you should be using.",5,6
a bit glitchy from time to time but overall a great tool for your business,5,6
does what i need it to do,5,6
i love it. easy to use. thanks,5,6
the old barcode scanner was much better,5,6
good for business anywhere....,5,6
best app  compare other mkt place,5,6
"the app would be better if it integrated more of the website features like initiating payment, granting someone access etc. overall a pretty good app though.",3,6
i am glad finally amazon cared about making app. it's getting better everyday. i really like photo editor features. it's very useful and made it easier to make white background picture.thank you the team who put efforts to make it happen.,5,6
saves money on paid apps,4,6
great app,5,6
i liked the old app better,2,6
easy to use!,5,6
nice,5,6
very useful,5,6
wish i could see and manage campaign activity with this app,4,6
cannot see how much your payments are past one week.,4,6
"the app is intuitive, it constant says no service. i can always check my results",4,6
very useful,5,6
"great app, love the barcode scanner.",5,6
"missing easily-fixed details that would make it usable as a replacement for the full browser version; can't provide a label for a return, can't quickly edit inventory, etc.  swing and a miss on an opportunity to support the sellers and develop a decent selling platform...but that is expected from amazon.",1,6
sahilmsahilfulzara,5,6
allows me to monitor daily sales from my smartphone,5,6

so far uses only for shipment delivery status tracking as a new bie and found app very helpful,4,6
amazon pickup service is too low quality,1,6

easyship service is too poor,1,6
the best company!,5,6
a great support from amazon,5,6
good,5,6
great seller app,5,6
they only support buyers . they did not any support sellers. only one mistake and your account is suspended. paytm ebay flipkart are more better then amazon,1,6
pathetic app ... not at all user friendly... you have to resort to using the desktop site for everything,1,6
not sure why qty sold now has 2 decimal places.  do people sell 2.25 pieces of a product? silly change.,4,6
makes.it so easy to check on business,5,6
nice,5,6
amazon yes this is amazon !!,5,6
always showing errors unable to get response from server.. useless app.,1,6
it's great,5,6
"this updated version lags so bad! the ""crunching numbers"" screen has literally sat running for minutes. meanwhile i'm waiting to scan products to see if i want to buy. wasting my time!!! before, even if i had a weak connection, i could start scanning.",2,6

collüòÑüòÉüòá,5,6
simple. easy scanner is great,5,6
preferd the previous version as the manage inventory page is not working at all and you were previously able to see your days sales instantly.,3,6
very best,5,6
great amazon seller app but could always use improvements to help sellers.                                                               update: many great improvements since my last review of this app,5,6
"this is great app, but i think it should offer additional features, i.e. alphabetical sorting, easier way to determine pricing of competitors for same condition books that i have for sale, etc.",4,6
"good app, but sometimes it tells me a product has no restrictions. i then buy the product and amazon won't let me sell it because it has restrictions...",4,6
loved every aspect the only thing is that the net has to running at a good speed or else the app doesn't loaf,5,6
works great!,5,6
nothing useless apps..,1,6
"this app is not worth it, better deal with a pc don't waste time downloading",1,6
improve your software for edit listing like pricing and tracking order facility.,2,6
it is all rounder,5,6

very hard to new user or seller,5,6
it's so helpful,5,6
better than before,5,6
i don't understand why i can't take a picture of my items and post it easily without this barcode scanning method,1,6
great tool to manage your fba inventory and to determine your price and profit points.  i'm very happy with this app.  it would get 5 stars from me if they would show when a scanned  item had been sold to help in determining current sale value of an item.,4,6
good aap,5,6
very  useful,5,6
an essential tool for running my business on  the go,5,6
very easy to work with this,5,6

easy to use,5,6
"good application, easy to view the order and working well for me.",5,6
amazing,5,6
needs to be able to filter out items not eligible to sale.,4,6
"last update very useful, app works well and allows more work to be done away from the office",5,6
"not bad! helps a lot when the books have no barcode, it can just scan the face of the book and your clear. it's a 10 to 5% change they don't have it but it help tho",5,6
very good for selling on amazon but it doesn't have all of the options available from the traditional website.,4,6
great customer service,5,6
great to scan pictures of the item,5,6
its been great since i have used it,5,6
couldn't do business on amazon without it,5,6
this is sooooo awesome i am using so many econ apps but this one is far more better then all,5,6
helpful app. would love better notifications and sound for example when a new sale comes in. would love notifications icon and a tab. thanks,4,6
payment tab and ui of not so easy understandable,2,6
wonderful,5,6
it's good,4,6
decent app to manage amazon sales and inventory. glitchy at times which is not ideal but overall works well enough.,5,6
"always saying the server can't be reached, try again. tired of it doing this.",2,6
great !,5,6
good app,5,6
it's good.,5,6
"the app it's ok for keeping track of sales and inventory, but it's not really meant for editing/managing account . from my point of view, would be a great plus to add a few functionalities like editing sale price, product keywords, and few more but i can also use it as it is and is great.",4,6
"**update 11/02/16 -- this app seems to have worked out the issues that made it keep freezing up on me. a little slow sometimes, but much better than before!! :)                                                           the app still continues to freeze on me, even after updating. it's great when it's working right, but very frustrating when i'm trying to use it and it keeps freezing! really slows me down!",5,6
"big improvement vs the previous version, but still a long way to go. no easy way to compare sales periods, no access to advertising data, no details on the bank balance",4,6
maximum fake product,1,6
very helpfull app for new starter.,5,6
doesn't allow me to log in. makes the app worthless,1,6

this app is useful to selling good,4,6

the app doesn't load. i have to switch between marketplaces and come back to uk marketplace for the home page to load,2,6
much imoroved over the past year. great for checking sales and responding to buyer messages.,5,6
great app,4,6
i really feel so glad to use it...,5,6
worst experiance i have ever had,1,6
its a very good app with specially this latest update which has increased its functionality. i think the 'manage orders' must include more features e.g. this tab must show the buyer's name also along with the order id which is missing.,4,6
great tool. thank you.,5,6
"very good app,  but ui could be better,  and there should be option for bulk process for unshipped orders",5,6
cant add category. instead it allows to select limited(not all category is available for selecting) category,1,6
good,5,6
more improvements needed for bulk editing.,4,6
it's a very good app and very easy to acess all the required things .,5,6
still needs to be more exhaustive. push notifications aren't instant yet.,4,6
good one,5,6
good for scanning  items and creating listings.  fba pending orders seem to show quicker. needs improvement for managing orders and manage inventory freezes.  i use s7 edge,4,6
easy & quick way to get more information about your seller account on amazon.,5,6
the commission is high for selling on amazon,1,6
i wanted to sell beauty products but in new listening i am not getting the option,1,6

very useful i get a lot out of this app,5,6
good for basic operations,4,6
"this is a horrible app for sellers trying to manage their accounts. no where can you view feedback, i won't even get into the inventory management issues. i'm uninstalling and going back to the classic site.",1,6
very nice,5,6
nice one,5,6
"could not sign in ,how can i sell if i can't even open app",1,6
it's fantastic  and significantly useful.... period,5,6
needs alot of improvement,2,6
excellent app.it can still be improved if products link are given on it so that one can view the listing on amazon.in.this will help to know how many other sellers are offering the product and product reviews as well. one more thing..there should be an option to change rates when an item has sale price other than the mrp.,5,6

very helpful that i can take my amazon business with me everywhere i go.,5,5
great sales tool,5,5
gr8,5,5
very good,5,5
good,5,5
the app has a hard time searching sometimes... i have to hit the back button and scan over and over... super annoying,4,5
super helpful for tracking sales. super easy to list things with the barcode scanner. only thing i would say they need to improve is you should be able to see the prices of similar items when your listing something. the computer virsion does this and i like it alot. so when i'm listing things i tend to list on my phone and look up prices on my computer. double work. wish they would fix that,4,5
nice app,5,5
really like the new app and i am seeing positive changes often.,5,5
this app is working great for me so far.,5,5

excellent . life made easy . business quick n easy,5,5
someone bought an item from me and guess what? this unreliable app didn't send me a notification! i just so happened to log on and saw that someone ordered something 5 days ago! what's the purpose of having this app if it doesn't notify you of anything?! i might as well uninstall this waste of space and get on my computer everyday to see if i made any sales!,1,5
great platform to buy & sell,5,5
using it for some time now. very useful app.  still missing some options from desktop version but good enough to use it on the go,5,5
"i works well but every so often it would say there is no connection although there is and sometimes when you click on a notification after selecting your market and company the screen is just blank, you have to swap countries and back again before it loads",4,5

easy access to lots of great info.,5,5
it has made my bussiness on amazon too easy...,5,5

i don't know whats wrong' but evertime i try to sell something my item doesn't go in my inventory.,3,5
nice app,5,5
good app! just please add a way to monitor sponsered ads campaigns.,5,5

excellent,5,5
the old version of this was better. this does not scan properly  especially on the uk site .the older version was a way better. never had any problems with that version. this version has a lot of glitch. but it is still a fantastic for selling.love amazon.,5,5
needs more options for order searches. i definitely like the sale notifications but that's about all its good for. i guess restocking on the go is also convenient but they definitely need to add more options for order management.,4,5
very good  performance  for selar,5,5
"quite a flaky app. doesn't always work, great when it does though.",3,5
they broke it with the new ui. do not have any updates for 3 days. tried relogging in an it says no response from server.,1,5
great,5,5
great.luv it,5,5
does not read barcodes well. other than that great  4.8 starsüòÄ,4,5
it's very easy to use and i love it,5,5
the fact i can track my sales on the go is great. this is my most used app on my device simply because i like checking my sales throughout the day. if i could have a widget that i could keep on my home screen to track sales that would be even better! i wouldn't even mind if the app ran in the background so it automatically syncs my sales information versus opening the app and waiting for it to load.,5,5
llplplllllllplllllllllllllllllllllll oodhd,5,5
ggreat all need improvement on the available options,5,5
hard to send additional  communication  with buyer's.,4,5
amazing app by amazon,5,5
really very user friendly and so smoothly works across the functionality needed for sellers.,5,5
"to be honest, amazon over ebay lol! ever since ebay restricted my page for no reason and messed up my business... i'm glad i joined amazon, too bad that i have to start from square one but its worth it. me and brother are just going in with our items. and it's easier to use than ebay in my opinion. faster and way better.",5,5

the app tracks customer orders great but would like to see  customer feedback and would like to have ability to track inbound fba shipments,4,5
better than the previous version,4,5
great 4 mobile device,5,5
good app. me likey.,5,5
for the most part it's okay. i really wish you could edit your listings from the app though. it's nice to look at them and change price but i'd like to be able to edit my whole listing from my phone.,3,5
this is amazing... app,5,5
very good,5,5
"overall, like the app and what it's potentials are. personally for me, i have issues using communication and managing orders. the only thing i can do with this app is look at my inventory and it doesn't show whether your prices are sales or regular prices so i don't trust to update prices using the app. i like looking at my sales of the day and comparing. there are other great features but as of now the communications and managing orders are not working for me.",3,5
there is no payment info.,4,5
"this is great!! i love amazon!! the more  i learne how to use there free apps and general tool's, the more i love it!!",5,5

"it can't do everything as well as seller central, but it doesn't have to. it does it's job quite well.",5,5
"app is okk,no issue, customer care,not support to indian seller,making false commitment without knowledge.",4,5
want to be little more modified,4,5
this app. is hard to track your sales. you should be able to see what you have sold and keep an up to date running total. not have to wait two or three days to see what you have sold and a 14 or 15 days to see the total sales for the pay period.,2,5
superb,5,5
lack of communication from seller account personnel to resolve issues quickly.,1,5
this app really help me manage my inventory even when i am not in my office... which make my work easier when i am outside,4,5
too bad for amazon,3,5
"excellent job, one stop solution",5,5

i love this app.. it really helps me keep a good about about sales and sales figures. i just hope it's maintained this way,5,5
nice,3,5
it's not perfect for any information for seller.,2,5
love it. very easy to use.,5,5
please impart information on returns  update the latest information .it shows updated 15 minutes back and actually it is not updated from last two days  (the graphic information),5,5
nice but some updates required,4,5
"wrong data,more clicks n swipes to get basic sales info.  poor ui design, it is neater but  less functional. wish i could go back to older version.",2,5
a great app..,5,5
need to update the app more so the seller can have more access through the app itself. especially advertising tab should be included.  else best app and best online portal to sell online undoubtedly.,5,5
"had strange quirks you wouldn't expect. like not being able to see today's summary of orders, or not being able to track fba shipments",3,5
fast and easy ...perfect for the seller who wants to save time..,5,5
"the app lets me check items, list and manage orders on the go...very easy to use, a real timesaver",5,5

"this app is too glitchy! it used to work perfectly, but since the latest release it hangs all the time and is inconsistent. i used to love it, now its a huge pia.",1,5
can't control shipping info here.  needs access to browser for more control.,2,5
"working good, navigation is perfect",5,5
awesome,5,5
great app for all,5,5
very well designed app.,5,5
"was great, now crashes when listing a product to sell",3,5
"unfortunately,  amazon does not keep the standards that they require their sellers to follow.  quick to the customer, slow or non responsive to the seller.",1,5

i wish there was a built in food replicator,5,5
i giving you thanks for providing a great portal to sell my products online,5,5
it is an excellent tool. love that it scans a product immediately. the charts are extremely helpful.,5,5
handy tool,4,5
"app is good, but only for checking your order and communicating buyers.",3,5
easy to use and standard platform by business,5,5
app  z ok..,4,5
i wish this app had some type off setting for sound so that way i could hear if i just got a new order. i would want to make this notification sound specific to the seller on amazon app. this is the reason for the 4 stars. other than that this app is so easy to use.,4,5
very nice app,5,5
"most features are available through the app, but not all. changing a shipment to add a tracking number has to be done through the regular seller webpage. lately every option has gotten me an error message. after struggling with it, it would have been faster to fire up my laptop.",3,5
i wish it had more features and real-time alerts of sales.,4,5
amazon will always exist. it's brilliant! purchase some stocks now.,5,5
love this app so far,5,5
it's excellent,5,5
amazing,5,5
annoying it links you to website to do 75% of any actual tasks you need to preform as a seller app is only useful for scanning items and browsing stuff,4,5
"this app is very frustrating, it gives you just enough information without actually being useful when dealing with withdrawal, account management or dealing with existing orders. it basically allows you to see what your selling and when it's sold in the move. but my emails give me this information anyway.",2,5
amazon is amazing,5,5
"excellent support to small business, thanks amazon @jeff bezos",5,5
"it's a handy app for sure, it help me to get basic important information. i wish i could more with it like manage fba shipping and printing labels. but, so far so good. new version takes many reloads to populate home area.",3,5
please fix the brand registration for new sellers soon.,3,5
"i wanted to use this to put in money for marketing, product promotions. this feature is not there",3,5
very good for quick updates,5,5
helpful!,5,5
i want to use it for the product photo feature. endless frustration. the background is never white enough.  new white plastic poster board. natural light next to north facing window.,2,5
nice and convenient to check sales,5,5
won't let me confirm shipment on a sale.,3,5
great app but would like to see more of the full seller central products made available,4,5
data refresh could be faster.,4,5

"wouldnt sell without it!,",5,5
great app,5,5
"one of the best selling plateforms found ever. seller has total control on what and how to sell. it is just like a virtual shop, where the selling and despatch policies are designed and governed by the seller himself. perfectly crafted for buyer and seller both.",4,5
it doesn't work all the time.,2,5
app is fantastic. would be better if its a bit more like the website,5,5
this app is very easy to operate ....fast label generates .....thank to amazon for providing another platform to seller ...,5,5

since the update it crashes non stop.  it looks good and i use it daily but you still need to log into seller central for the important stuff,2,5
signing out too many times. very slow compared to previous version. asking for phone verification everytime you sign in.,2,5

great  app!!!   specially  while i was on abroad and traveling  this helps me to do all i wanted,5,5
"i've only recently started selling on amazon and this app is useful for checking basic info on the go but it's difficult to find information on shipments, etc. i'd also like to be able to start listings on the app and finish them later when i'm on my laptop with more of the info i need to finish them off. also if you scan an item that isn't on the catalogue and then go to add it as a new item, it should carry the number you scanned forward to the info screen.",3,5

superb app! very useful for anyone‚Äãselling on amazon.,5,5
"super selling service by amazon,  but calling department not good services on amazon.",5,5
add new products is horrible. not easy to calculate company & shipping charges,2,5
customers message show late,2,5

better app than others but something need to be done for uploading inventory and product as every time it is not working properly.,5,5
excellent app,5,5
"app is ok.  improvements could be made.. let me add a photo to my listings  please.  you cannot imagine how much time that would save every seller! app is currently very very glitchy, no point having it if it won't let you log in for several days at a time",1,5

quite intuitive app. had a big a few days back affecting refreshing data. now seems fixed.,4,5
love this app,5,5
its good for checking stock basic work really. hard work to find orders as scrolling through list to what send shows no name or order id. have to type long order id number just to find the right order when  checking. does have occasional server issues but probably poor internet does that. does everything else i need it to do so do recomend for the sellers out there using amazon.,4,5
so manny errors in this app,2,5
i'm highly upset my amazon seller account does not work i have talk with over 20 reps and i have waited over 3 weeks for my account to be fixed and nothing,1,5
awesome,5,5
useful. latest update fixed the non-loading homescreen.,4,5
some time its very slow,3,5
not seller friendly,1,5
i'd like to see bluetooth support and a database mode for offline.,4,5

"great app overall, would be nice to be able to see fees with vat included to make it easier. also, manage returns and communications randomly shows noyifications when there is nothing there. apart from that, love it.",5,5
"the app started out okay, and is now great, with more updates frequently. major kudos to the app team for building a great app that works for multiple business models that all sell on amazon!",5,5
used to be good and could be great but problems with redesign in early 2017 have slowed it to a standstill rendering it unusable,1,5
"edit:  seems they fixed it.    won't load home page after update. just ""crunches numbers"" forever. also doesn't display correct inventory. desktop site is right, but info is not carried over into app.",4,5
"was perfect, up until a week ago, now is doesn't populate most of the time, only after a bunch of refresh attempts and than only does so every so often. hopefully this gets fixed because it was an extremely useful tool. update...new patch back to working great!",5,5

very useful for sellers,5,5
the scanning feature is my favorite. great app!,5,5

great free app,5,5
"prefer working from my pc, but love the cha ching sound!!",4,5
uploading a product is an issue to be resolved by amazon,3,5
there's bugs but that's because my phone is messed up. works great with my other apps with no hassle.,5,5
i have a samsung galaxy s7 and i loved the app before the new update. now it won't load anything. it just buffers.,3,5

not working lately.,2,5
love it,5,5
helpful.,5,5
this app crashes a lot.,3,5
good,5,5
i like it. you can take a picture instead of scan. the sales rank can be off sometimes though.,5,5
it was ok until latest upgrade and now slow,2,5
great app very relevant to doing business in the amazon site.,5,5
needs work. the titles of products should scroll so we can see individual sku performance. graphs should be pie charts. with the release of 4.2.0 the home screen is unstable and rarely loads on gs7.,3,5
after the most recent update it doesn't work at all now,1,5
after the new update the application is not working after you install i works perfectly for 2-3 times after that it would not work properly.,1,5
is perfect for business,5,5
"this is india's no 1 fraud platform. where any buyer can cheat seller and amazon trust the fraud buyer and don't believe us (2 year old 100% positive rating seller) so we are closing our account and will publish all our experience and video evidence, mail in twitter,  facebook and youtube ""how can anyone cheat any seller and take costly mobile phone, laptop at free of cost"" worst policy, worst service.. we are moving towards flipkart and snapdeal.",1,5
"i loved the old version so much.  this one sucks.   i can barely refresh my sales , and view the daily activities.   it keeps stalling.   not good at all.",3,5
great idea but takes ages to load. not good when sourcing products or when trying to add products.,3,5

i don't know what you did from last update. this is absolutely disaster. it takes forever to upload so i thought it was my phone so i turned it on and turn off my phone like 3 times. ummm. i like old version way better and i am still not use to this update version. probably never will. please fix it so i can do my business easy way.,1,5
"used to be great but now constantly frozen.  scans and lists, show all available offers, rank, and even product details.",2,5

"99% of the time, it does exactly what i need it to.",5,4
"not sure what's going on, but i'm having to uninstall and reinstall to view my data. if i don't it just sits in a state of constant refresh.",3,4
wastes more time waiting for it to crunch the numbers.  not the time saver i hoped it would be,2,4
site has become slow and crashes to often,3,4
incredibly useful when out in the wild hunting for new merchandise for the store!,5,4
important features like payments and returns missing in app.,3,4
well done to amazon in improving the app. very useful new features and performs quickly.,5,4
great app,4,4
the app works fine after the upgrade but only after you log out & back in.,4,4

excellent app,5,4
"abysmal service! be warned amazon will suspend your account without any warning for no reason whatsoever.  they hold your funds and make you wait 90 days to receive your hard earned cash, and you will never be able to sell on amazon again.  my account was suspended indefinitely for listing three products which i immediately took down, and still, i can never sell again.  i was severely mistreated by amazon, and they couldn't care less.  be warned, sell on ebay or another platform because amazon will burn you hard!",1,4

i love this app. ease of use and has great features that is most valuable to any seller or customer.,5,4
app hasn't worked for 3 days straight.,1,4

performance is very bad,2,4
easy to navigate.,4,4
i like it its easy to move through it.  the only problem is it gets glitchy sometimes and have to restart my phone to get rid of the problems,4,4
good,5,4
it crashes on me a lot and tells me that i am not connected to the internet. i wish there was a way to select the data that you wanted to see when you scanned an item to sell too.,3,4
"the product photo booth is excellent! great app, especially for free. i wish i could force an actual real-time refresh, but other than that, pretty darn nice.",4,4
shipping information can't be modified. no response from customer support...,2,4
can any one tells me where to generate ean upc or asin code for free to list a single poduct on amazon,3,4

amazon selling app is just amazing.,5,4
just simply amazing. everything i need for a business app. thanks amazon. you changed my life,5,4
awesome interface.,5,4
good seller aap and nice work,5,4
the app has improved dramatically. the only feature i don't see is the ability to change your vacation status from the app. otherwise it is responsive and i can manage my business from my phone.,4,4
this app simply closes every time i open it. i have installed it twice. big fail.,1,4
this app is best for amazon sellers. i sell my produced on amazon and this app is best way to check you status on amazon.   you can search on amazon.  name - ratnavali arts  and again thanks amazon to provide this app for sellers i love this app üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò,5,4
starting to learn to sell on amazon and this app works great for finding stuff to sell and to check the stuff your selling.,5,4
"convenient and easy to navigate. makes it easy to reply to messages on the fly and review orders.  glitchy, unfortunately. pages often won't load, communications don't always go through, and pricing opportunities aren't always accurate.  would be nice if they added an easy way to switch to a secondary shipping structure (free shipping, flat shipping, etc). the latter would help immensely",3,4
very good complete app for sellers,5,4
"it lacks a lot of functionality which any seller would need to use. for example you can not access campaign manager and check your pay per click, no ability to access business reports to check on conversion, page views and other information.  the only thing this app is good at is checking the sales (even that can be improved with filters on product for example)",3,4
"wow. this app has really grown up with the latest version. so much useful and helpful information, right at the tips of my fingers",5,4
"not user friendly, facing problem for my product.",1,4
when i dispach on pc my default carrier royal mail is already chosen for me and i can literally click one 'dispached' button. however when dispatching from phone i have to pick carrier every single time. the list is also so so long. why uk account needs italian or german mail delivery carriers? scrolling up and down on the screen to mark one item as dispached takes at least 2 minutes... what a waste of app...,2,4
crashes and shuts down when searching for new products,2,4

good home page. but please also provide a platform to manage ad campaigns.,4,4
very useful but you should add advertising reports,5,4
"i cannot live without this app, but i have had to uninstall and reinstall it four times now. it simply stops working for no reason",1,4
nice app,5,4

worst app. i am not a amazon seller but amazon was charged  2600rs for amazon seller account. if i contact amazon seller support nobody lifting phone.,1,4
"after every 24 hrs the app needs to be uninstalled and installed again because i have been getting an error message which only gets removed after installing the app again. pathetic exprience, help level provided by app is 0",1,4
this app sucks.....nothing is easy to use and does not satisfy me.....do not use this... please..,1,4

"horrible since the last update! the app crashes when i click ""add product"". it just shuts down completely, saying ""sorry, amazon seller has stopped"". there is no option to search any product anymore, neither by asin number nor by name. oh, did i mention that the camera search is useless too? i still continue using amazon flow app for that, 'cause that one gives you all the available options. bring back the search button on the home page, like it used to be in the old version of amazon seller app! it used to be so convenient. no one cares about all those added fancy useless features if the most important features don't work!",1,4

nyc app,5,4
love this app.  so easy compared to profit bandit.  i do have two questions.  is it possible to access camel camel camel from the amazon app?  after scanning an item is it possible to show only items with a rank?  i don't like relying on other random items that skew pricing compared to ranked items.,5,4

great,5,3
"it's ok. i expect a lot more from amazon and i'm sure it will happen. but i want to be able to click on an order and easily see the product detail page when i want. also, when i sell something, it would be great if it showed how many i have left in stock, as an alert for me to restock when possible. and when in the manage orders screen, why can't i sort by item price? sometimes i want to look at my recent high value orders so i can remember them and keep an eye out for them. i have a retail store too, so if something sells well (or for more) on amazon, being able to quickly see these items helps me.",4,3
lovely and very beneficial.,5,3
great app.  takes out all of the guess work.,5,3
keeps freezing,3,3
still doesn't have all sales graphs like website. should have one click on home page to last year monthly/yearly sales charts.,3,3
"easy to navigate app, great info to manage seller account.",5,3
easy to use and clean interface,5,3
"it is nice to have the ability to access my account from my phone. however, answering communications in somewhat cumbersome and finding orders is a multi step process.",4,3
great,5,3
some items description showing wrong. need improvement.,4,3
good aap,5,3
awesome features,5,3
quick and easy,5,3
my store on mobile.  thanks a lot amazon. you are the best.,5,3
enjoying the app so far.  easy to use.,5,3
what an idea sir ji,5,3
i think this is the best because we can alert when we are out of business area.,5,3
it is a seller app,4,3
not all features are accessible versus accessing seller central through a computer.,4,3
one word well done amazon for such a brilliant app....,5,3
great app,5,3
constantly having server issues,1,3
should be more options to edit listing delete item etc. should be able to see if u already selling item so no duplicates and many more....,2,3
"app is great to quickly review orders, respond to customer requests, snapshot of sales...very easy to use!",5,3
i think that amazon is a great service.,5,3
i love it time saver,5,3
useless update. now the app is not working after last update. always showing no internet connection.,5,3
"great app, however i am being restricted in categories that i'm ungated in?",5,3
the price  should be low,4,3
this is another mental play game by amazon. they just want vendors to be psychological slave for lifetime.. first thing you open and see are sales.profits for any vendor is negligible. by creating this app they want to seller to stay updated and sell more and further pile more losses.,1,3
older app was more friendly.,1,3
good,5,3
gud,5,3
pls add some more features like payment account summary etc.,3,3
i love this app,5,3
it's good but can be better as difficult to search a particular sku ; returns are not available to see,3,3
great experience,5,3
very easy and convenient to use on the go to check order status!,5,3
need to add marketing campaign info,3,3
great app,5,3
"awesome easy to use, seller friendly!",5,3
love it. thanks amazon,5,3
always crashing and exiting out of app,5,3
excelent merchant/seller management app with great features for all your reports and support services. #loveamazonseller,5,3
great new look and very valuable for the entrepreneur on the go. i hope they add even more to it over the next few months.,5,3
"great app for watching your sales and communicating with customers, but lacks with item listings.",4,3
"extremely well made app, has all the functions i want in this type of app.",5,3
"sometimes  when you try to edit inventory,  there's  no option to hit save",4,3
app is very user friendly!,5,3
nice app competition management could've been added,5,3
nice,5,3
the app won't let me edit prices after recent update.  please fix!,1,3
it's superb. really an amazing. very easy to use. keep track of everything. best way to sell my product without messup. i love it.,5,3

i love this app... change my life,5,3
love the ease of use.,5,3
more better than 2 years ago,4,3
when i click on add product amazon app closes.,2,3
its a good app and easy to use.,4,3
amazing app .. just loved it,5,3
i enjoy the alerts and watching my amazon store grow on the go. any where i am i can check on orders. it really helps speed up the process to get shipments out.,4,3
its worst app. the devs have gone cynical.,1,3
i haven't found anything that needs improvements.,5,3
i was forced to rate the app to use it.....that's a huge negative,3,3
"used to be great app. but with the changes,  i hate it!!!!! so many bugs amazon needs to fix!!!!",1,3
could be better if the app can access ppc status.,4,3
excellent!!!!,5,3
"great way to sell your things. very easy to manage.  the only complaint that i have, is that i wish the received payments were set-up in a different way. i think it's only right, when you confirm shipment,  that's when you should receive your payment.  not wait 14 days, then a extra 1-2 days to have cleared in your bank account.",4,3
just start using this app and like it so far.,5,3
new changes suck. can't change inventory prices as before.,2,3
a lot of product that i sell it's not on your site. also i tried to sell a item and use that item existing barcode and it will not take it period i think you need to do a little bit more work on barcode,3,3
needs advertising information added,3,3
great app to track everything on the go.,5,3
good,5,3
keep away from this apps to much waiting to get your payment from the item you sold and you will loss money on shipping ...bad place to sell your items....,1,3
ok,3,3
all in all. good compilation of data. nice interface. shows most that is required. manage orders section needs improvement as many pending orders are shown there. only received orders should be shown. rest everything is fine,5,3
excellent app,5,3
excellent for keeping live track of sales . a must for any amazon seller,5,3
everything is great so far great app makes life easy thanks,5,3
good service of amazon   thanks,4,3

awesome experience for a seller,5,3

really easy to use miss the way you could look up stuff you had scanned before and since update it keeps shutting off,5,3
so easy to use and fast!,5,3
i managed all my sales through this app only,5,3
easy to navigate and use for seller central,5,3
nice apps...,5,3
"it's decent, but could definitely stand to be a little more intuitive and user friendly.....",3,3
easy  & fast but flipkart is still better atleast in aap,5,3
i would like to see in real time what i sold instead of having to login to my account,5,3
this app is very helpful and informational. i would like to see more history on scanned item.,4,3
"the app has been fairly good in terms of managing the account anywhere, anytime however i  would request amazon to add more features to it.",5,3
good,4,3
very light and good app,5,3
usually works well. sometimes unable to get reception. happy i have it.,4,3
helps me stay on track with my small business. very satisfying to hear the little alert when something sells and managing it is a breeze!,5,3
love this app. it is so easy to use,4,3
couldnt get by without this app.,5,3
awesome to have this app at my fingertips!,5,3
i am in love with this app. it's so simple to use. more than the computer,4,3

"i'd like it to have the ability to deal with return requests. other than that, working fine. update, manage returns added so now it's fabulous. next, add cancel and get it available for the amazon fire!",4,3
it's need too much work,3,3

best selling app,5,3
i love this app its very helpful to see everything on the go :),4,3

great app for sellers on the go!,5,3
good for the basics,5,3
excellence,5,3
love using this app it's so easy,5,3
good app,5,3
decent for crunching numbers but a bit tough to track shipments,5,3
it's ok,3,3

worst app and worst service,1,3
easy to use. even for a novice.,5,3
"amazon is terrible, i sell on amazone for 15 years never had a problem, last week they closed my account because somebody told them that i was selling fake visine eyedrops. without any warning they just. close your account. i quit my job for amazone, now i have no i come have to sell my house.its unacceptable. i proved that the drops where the real one bouth at walmart and cvs with the reciept. but still they dont want to open my account. becare full if you start selling on amazone they dont give a dime on the sellers",1,3
love it!,5,3
nice update,5,3
love it,5,3
awesome app.. compare to paytm,5,3
does what it supposed to do. works absolutely fine.,5,3
"completely unusable now. at first i liked it, but now there is a banner demanding a review. it's blocking all usage of the app. there is no way to make it go away. this is unacceptable. you wanted a review that badly? well, here it is.",1,3
helpful when on the move!,5,3
"easily manage our online market place in us and canada from my phone, wow.",4,3
"they tried to put in everything in one app , it is better for fast usage like replying and checking orders etc",4,3
works great easy to use üëç,5,3
unshipped orders r shown shipped..,4,3
much better app now.,5,3
i love this app but when i receive a new order alert and go to check don't take me to the order to see what it is. that happens sometimes.,5,3
"putting a message on my account that says ""please rate the app"" that i can't escape from makes this review lower.  forcing me to review is unacceptable. how do i get the message off the app.  it locks me out of the app. is there a way to disable that.  i end up rebooting my phone in order to access my account. then it pops back up. is this a bug that needs a fix?",3,3
i expect more updates....,5,3
have loved it so far. been using for about 2 months with no issues.,5,3
update 3/17 forced me to update and now wont open. s7!!!   **freezes nonstop on s7.  i like it but it has 2 big flaws. 1)speed. 2) no pictures can be taken with my 2 droid phones during listing like it let's me with my iphone.  if they ever get this thing to print labels as you go and take photos for your listing... it would be awesome.,1,3
nice app,5,3
great app. please ad access to advertising.,5,3
user friendly with lot of features.,5,3
good for sourcing,4,3
i am unable to list items from the app.,2,3
awesome!,5,3
i use the app all the time.   very easy and user friendly,4,3
excellent and fully loaded with useful features. the only downside personally is not being able to stop refreshing every 5 mins to check on new sales orders!,5,3
it great!,5,3
much better scanner!,5,3
i would really like to be able to manage our advertising campaigns from the app,4,3
great. very instrumental in my business,5,3
very convenient for product search; easy to use.  great application tool. thanks amazon,5,3
very very good,4,3
previous one was easier to navigate.,3,3
the photographs not showing so uninstalling the app.,1,3

love this app especially after the update,5,3
fantastic app! so many useful features and free!,5,3
brilliant,5,3
overall i am pleased with this app.,4,3
good app,4,3
nice but processor is little slow,4,3
"this app is amazing. i love it, you can easily do things in your store on the go, interestingly when hijackers penetrate into my store and was freezed by amazon while investigations was going on, i was able to see activity going on in my store through this app. this app is no brainer.  however  if we can buy shipping label and upload tracking number automatically will be really wonderful.",5,3
i love how much information i can see from my phone.,5,3
very nice app to provide instant reply to my clients,5,3
loved seeing how my business grows.,5,3
awesome,5,3
superb app.,5,3
generally good,4,3
can't connect to seller support.,4,3
stop hiding things from seller. thieves,1,3
awesome app!,5,3
great app. been using it as a double check with my other app to verify that i'm going to make the decision on my purchases.,5,3
great app! one thing that can be improved on is having your inventory accurate which seems to be an issue.,4,3
awesome way to make yo pockets fatter,5,3
too many touches needed when scanning,4,3
it's not bad. could be better.,4,3
"when a sale goes through, it isn't super obvious which item from my inventory sold. you'd think that they'd make it super simple and user friendly. how about a notice like ""you just sold one t. rex dinosaur toy."" other than that, it serves its purpose.",3,3
"intuitive menus, easy to learn.",5,3
"great features, very useful",5,3
some times confusing,4,3
"awesome, for a small seller like me its easybto understand, taanks amazon india",5,3
great,5,3
it works well,5,3
"very limited. very buggy. very incomplete. very carelessly broken. that said, it is occasionally mostly useful, as long as you don't expect it to do everything it's supposed to do.",1,3
"can't enter new products, keeps crashing",2,3
much better after recent updates.  still room for improvement but overall a great tool!,5,3
its on point great communication tool for your customers also,5,3
need improve the iventory management,4,3
this app needs notification whereby we should be alerted when sell happens also request you to have online integration with seller portal. sometimes portal shows items are sold and app shows no sales.,3,3
this is a great app. just wish it had the cash register cha ching  when you get a sale. there also seems to be a lag in between getting a sale and it updating. other than that love the app. easy to see sales and manage orders.,5,3
app is fine,3,3
great but wish i could get more reports similar to the online version,5,3
perfect app for selling your items on amazon,5,3
good,4,3
it is a good app. very easy to understand.,5,3
love it,4,3
great news features showing charts,4,3
it is what it is.  there is an annoying feature that pops up insisting you rate it.,2,3
excellent app for sellers,5,3
"forced feedback, nuff said.",1,3
could be better,3,3
"works great, helps me stay on top of my orders and inventory.",5,3
great app for selling on amazon.,5,3
"kudos to the  app team, good tool for being out in the trenches.",4,3
it hangs from time to time !,4,3
jst uber cool!!!,5,3
all  good,5,3
easy to use,4,3
it's getting there....,4,3
helps a lot in our business,5,3
works great!,5,3
just started the app...haven't figured it all out. biggest concern is how long it takes to scan and get results.,4,3
"great app , it has everything u need  in one place.",5,3
good app with no issues,4,3
a perfect app for on the go,5,3
i like using this app,4,3
"the new and improved app gives great stats on the fly, and allows you to aee your sales, pending sales as well as communication",5,3
good app so far. it gets me access to the essential functions .,5,3
love it!!! literally can run a business with just my phone.,5,3
i do wish you could silence the voice in a store when you are scanning.,5,3
keep it up,5,3
constantly giving errors that is only resolved by shutting down and restarting. great app otherwise if they would just fix that.,2,3
i think the app is better than the web version,4,3
amazing app!,5,3
wirks,5,3
excellent app...,5,3
i love the added features. great!!!,5,3
great app. nice work!,5,3
simply awesome,5,3
i hate the fact that when a sale happens it is automatically shown in your graphics but then if it is refunded the next day or week then the amount does not get subtracted from the total of your sales and it gets confusing. i think there is a lot to be improved for example you should be able to see all the orders done by fba on your phone. now you can not do that. you should also ad a space clearly visible on front page where we could see our feedback rate and where we could access it. thx,5,3
"the pace at which they are improving, is commendable. cheer :)",4,3
"great app to sell items on amazon. simple and easy to use. gives you the ability to scan the item, like the front of a book, and it automatically comes up with the item information (as long as it's already listed on amazon). you can also scan a barcode through the app and it comes up with the item information. highly recommend!",5,3
great tool for any amazon seller,5,3
restart evey time i open .,2,3
app is quite useful for managing on the go,5,3
good app,5,3
i am very happy with this app.. superv nd nice app,5,3

nice,5,3
superb! i can't believe i run my business from an app.,5,3
this is a good app and easy to use,5,3
easy to use,5,3
it's a good app but it would be even better if ppc management was included,4,3
good app.. the benefit  of a profit total would be nice..  as it can already be input via the app anyway,5,3
best,5,3
need much improvement in managing inventory.,4,3
nice app for numbers and on the go movement of business. absolutely love it. i think it is the most used app on my phone.,5,3
one can manage whole selling account anytime anywhere,5,3
it's not bad,3,3
not very stable on android 6.0.1,3,3
great news finally this app is not working properly,1,3
much easier to understand now,5,3
it's so much easier to keep an eye on your sales. i love how this allows me to pop in and check on things throughout my day!,5,3
not as good as the old version for seeing  sales,1,3
simple and easy app...very nice,5,3
its great!,5,3
helping sellers to manage account easily,5,3
so far so good,4,3
its an awesome app my business is flourishing with it ! :-) :-) :-),5,3
i am very happy...,5,3
loving it!  love the alerts. up to date information without having to search for it,5,3
they have very good policies for big sellers which is not allowing to sell something individual sellers. i prefer ebay than amazon,1,3
lovely,5,3
not as per amazon standard,1,3
good,5,3
"amazing, really helpful, so quick simply i love it.",5,3
great app. only problem is that now i check my numbers way too often...,5,3
very good app,5,3
"i like this app but would like a few imp things included. for example, in orders, why not show qty sold, qty remaining etc, so that action can be taken then and there.",4,3
"extremely frustrating update. i'm a european seller and every time i want to click into a different country i have to do it 2 times until it will enter the country's screen, then i have to press home to get stats.",2,3
it's a nice a app... great help for becoming an amazon seller,4,3
quit changing where everything is!,2,3
wish it did calculations like profit bandit,4,3
nice working,4,3
"can't change  prices in app. can't filter orders by sku,  asin,  etc",3,3
good app,5,3
good for quickly checking sales stats,4,3
gdd,4,3
like it,5,3
good,5,3
awesome,5,3
best app,5,3
amazon is very helpful,5,3
too slow and malfunctions alot,2,3
thanks for the great tools and tips,5,3
i really like the new graph on the landing page seeing the results of my sails from the past compared to today. watching it go up is great!,5,3
very nice app...,5,3
professional organisation to work with.,5,3
it's good.. üòÜüòÜ,4,3
amazon keeps on improving. clean and handy app to get an overview.,5,3
it notifies me when i sell an item but it doesn't tell me what i sold. i have to go to my desktop computer to find out. the application was much better last year.,1,3
it's good,4,3
best business app,4,3
"amazon is an absolutely terrible company to work with i am being extorted by a customer claiming he received a broken item when he admitted to trying to take it apart, amazon is making me pay for return shipping for this guy to break my item or replacing it with an item his friend broke as he said his friend sells them. i had great hopes for amazon but now i won't ever buy a thing from them again. terrible company terrible app awful agents and worse customers.",1,3
"it's great overall, but i shouldn't have to exit the app and go through the amazon website to more quickly manage inventory pricing and request fund transfers. why can't sellers simply click on their current balance box in the app and submit a payment distribution request?",3,3
"amazon is a terrible place for sellers! the free selling account is nearly unusable, (which i'm sure they do on purpose) and they charge you $40 for the real selling account. ebay is free even with high volume and you get full functionality. amazon sucks all around don't waste your time. just use ebay.",1,3
good but there are opportunities at inventory creation end,4,3
the app would not open on my tablet.,1,3
"works great! fast, simple, and convenient.",5,3
wonderful easy to use,5,3
satisfied,5,3
let's me add product as well as alert me of new orders.,5,3
app has errors very often,2,3
works seamlessly.  wish i can view transactions on the app too.,5,3
it's always show still working. not helpful. old version is better than this,4,3
carshes issue.new update useless.,1,3
"so far, so good...",4,3
üòßüò∞üò≠üò©,2,3
easy way to keep track of inventory and shipments. notification via app and email is helpful.,5,3
great app and easy to use,5,3
cant open after installing it . need to fix this error cant use this app. i installed several time  after click on india the app not responding.,1,3
good work done,5,3
ah! previous app was much better. previous app used to let us compare sales with last week's sales with current week's sales.,3,3
working well so far,5,3
it need to download,5,3
great app to keep up on daily sales and reply to customers. super smooth and we'll built.,5,3
the best out there.,5,3
aliist,5,3
"i loved the old app it allowed you to be in the warehouse and get info on the flash as you are picking your items. it was a great help me for to have the date i have put the item in stock. this is sadly missing in the new version.  other problems with the new app are :  - its slow, sorry dashboard and kpis are great but not on this app anyone that wants them can get them online in their own sellers area. please amazon get rid of this feature it causes slowness and makes the app crash.  - when an item is sold or message is send you get the notification for that but in the new app its nos synching properly, beforehand it would open up the item in question or the message but now most times you only get to the front screen which makes you waste a lot of time.  - the usual cant get data, app crashed  mentioned by other reviewers which never happened on the previous version.  i think the programmers would want to go back to useability of the older version and do a lot more bug testing.",1,3
it keeps on crashing,2,3
it takes a lot of time to initialize and frequently lises connection to serer despite good internet connection.,3,3
great app!! very easy to use.,5,3
i've been impressed app is great.  good job.,5,3
good parfum,5,3
jackpot,5,3
works so much better.,5,3
great app god bless,5,3
great way to track what's going on when i am away from my office and reply to inquiries and requests.,5,3
this app is my lifeline to amazon. it's what i rely on for sales notifications.,5,3
the app is better with the latest updates,4,3
an excellent update. thank you amazon.,5,3
awesome,5,3
best app for business,5,3
"amazon seller accounts have too many limitations and they hold your payments way longer than any other provider. they also put a hold on your credit card every week in order for you to get paid. i contacted them and every week they say i will get paid the following week. this has been going on for 3 weeks now. still no payment. the date keeps changing every week. amazon makes all the money and leave sellers with pennies. they want you to do all the work, all the promoting, all the marketing. and pay selling fees. so if i'm doing all the work why are we paying commission on every item plus credit card processing fees? you better off building your own site and keep all the cliental for yourself. amazon is a prime example of big box middle man website that makes millions off of thousands of sellers but yet the sellers don't make a penny in comparison. not recommended.",1,3
seems to do everything i needed to do when i needed to do it,5,3
new changes are good,4,3
doe's what's needed but could do with allowing users to have quiet times.,4,3
love the app use it daily world as well as high priced apps. i rely on this app every day,5,3
the app keeps showing no response from server. very irritating.,1,3
"very convenient app. no need to go to pc, anyone can run their business from mobile. anywhere any time...",5,3
useless application,1,3
fix the server issue already,1,3
simple product search without scan is gone from menu...,4,3
this app is feel like own store...,5,3
makes selling easy!,5,3
very helpful for research,5,3
"had to uninstall and reinstall to fix my original complaint, which i will leave in case anyone else has a similar problem. would be better if updates actually updated the app though.  original post: this app used to work well for my needs, but no longer works. i nearly failed to ship orders and respond to communications because i started to rely on the notifications from the app, but it stopped sending notifications and there doesn't seem to be a way to make it work again.",5,3
"i installed this app to use it for a business i could not start for some reasons, then they started charging me for not using it at all for many months. everytime i asked them to close my account and stop charging me, they did refund me, but the next month they would charge me again! i hate this app! i hate amazon seller! i am about to sue them...",1,3
this app can be a nightmare to use most of the time. i can count on it freezing up and forcing me to restart my phone at least once if not more when i use it.,1,3
the older app was so much better. i get as far as putting in my password and typing in the code then it starts to load but does not complete the load and logs me out automatically.,1,3
"super handy! although it's not a complete substitute for the site it's excellent for ""scanning"" out in the wild.",5,3
one of the best app among competition.,5,3
most of the time i am not getting sales alert. also it crashes sometimes.,4,3
a perfect app to look after my business on amazon all the time,5,3
very poor seller supports . i am not received by payment from amazon last 1 months when i am call the amazon seller supports. there agent only hold the call 20- 30 mins. i am thinking to left the amazon. and very low orders received. my catalog is approx 304 but received only 5-10 orders per day. and on flipcart catalog is 304 and i am received 600-800 orders per day. poor service by amazon.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,1,3
very easy to use and manage inventory.,4,3
"great to scan and input items for same, still figuring out notifications though.",5,3
very effective,4,3
amazon is sucking up my earning with the raise on fees. it's incredible. it really sucks!,1,3
"new to app, but so far it is very user friendly.",5,3
very bad new version only lodging lodging  sales graphics is not good,1,3
the server is slow and does not stay connected to be able to track communications and orders efficiently.,2,3
perfect,5,3
its a very good app. thanks amazon,5,3
excellent,5,3
really handy application for tracking selling information during the day quickly.   helpful in all areas just like seller central full site.,5,3
pleased so far.,5,3
good job,5,3
a major missing feature is being able to mute notifications during the night! it's getting better with each update.,4,3
it's a great app and it does what it's supposed to do it's actually easier navigate then the website,5,3
can't sign in,1,3
nice interface,5,3
app is great but it is crashing many times before showing dashboard. please resolve crashing issue. overa app is great. very helpful.,5,3
the app is easy to use and i love the new changes.,5,3
"so helpful as a seller, easy to check in to how your products are selling.  i use this app every day",5,3
great app,5,3
app misses some very important features like -  1.ads/promotion management and expenditure  2. payment details  3. expected payout on every product   amazon should work on its app to add such important features,3,3
best informative management app on mobile,5,3
amazon continues to roll!!,5,3
love it,5,3
could be better but still invaluable tool for any seller,5,3
very good app!,4,3
"seems really intuitive, easy to get around.",5,3
i like it,5,3

please update it for new product listings.,4,3
"this app doesn't run on my one plus 3t device. did the uninstalling - installing process for over 10 times. as soon as i login, app asks me to re enter the credentials with captcha and then the app logs out automatically.",1,3
need to update,4,3
"this app is ok. but some features need to be refined. for instance, when reviewing your pricing, you can't see your minimum and maximum price, so it is easy to have your listing suspended because you went past your set threshold.",3,3
new version is very good,5,3
great app for sellers. lets me know when i have an order to ship with a distinct sound. lets me contact buyers even when i am away from my computer and my store so i can tell them when i will ship their orders.,5,3
this app is fantastic...makes keeping track of my business so much easier!!,5,3
reliable.   easy to use,5,3
excellent.,5,3
for updated version.üëé,2,3
good app,5,3
its a great application.. still need little amendments in app. anyways loved it to core..,5,3
the best app for seller,5,3
"like most of the other new reviews, i've found that it takes longer to load. it doesn't matter if i'm in a store using my data or at home with wifi, it will give me the same slow loading time or not connect at all",2,3
this app is helping me alot in making profitable choices.,5,3
good for keeping track,4,3
new update not work,1,3
very nice to use,5,3
"user interface not good.  order processing is not same as on computer. invoice is not generated when it is processed by app.  also,under manage orders page, buyer name is not mentioned. you have to open the order for order details.",2,3
esau business handling with this,5,3
easy to use and very good app,5,3
its not useful and is very confusing,1,3
"latest update crashes or will not go to where you click just opens a screen instructing to ""try again later""; poorly implemented and is now bloatware. 8 months and older versions of this app are so much more useful.  come on amazon you are too rich and powerful for such an amateur, useless, unprofessional, app!",1,3
efficient tool for mobile seller account management.,5,3
facing problem in new product uploads,5,3
nice..,4,3
everything can be managed the same as from a desktop or pc.,5,3
easy to manage your amazon account from your phone or ipad!,5,3
great app!,5,3
"everything in one place, easy to keep track of sales in uk and europe.",4,3
i am enjoying this app very helpful.,5,3
like it,4,3
not consistently indicating new orders on phone screen.,4,3
helpful app for sellers but needed improvement.,4,3
information given by the app doesn't match info available to buyers.,1,3

üëéüëéüëé,1,3
good dashboard,5,3
"i wish i could see which actual items sold, not just units or total revenue",4,3
"how about instead of colorful graphs, you create the capability to copy listings or some other useful means of creating new listings. searching isn't good enough. speaking of searching, you cannot narrow anything down beyond category. i'll stick with my laptop for the time being.",3,3
try to update more so that amazon charges & net payable amount is shown at order arrival for future management.,4,3
i really enjoy using this app a lot easier to navigate. it puts everything you need to see about your business on one page.,5,3
user friendly..,5,3
it's good for notifications,4,3
the app has been a great addition to thw growth of my business.,5,3
"if you want the statistics, it is easier to read in the old app. the new one does not provide enough information in the charts. navigation is also different. depending on your use, this could be beneficial. for me, i look for specific elements and some of those are no longer available through the current navigation. it's ok, and i really use the app to notify me of purchases in the event text messages are not functioning (it happens every now and again).",3,3
i like how easy it is not to need a laptop. i use my phone to sell things.,5,3
nice app,5,3
"amazing amazon app, make life easier!",5,3

great app. shows sales charts. would love if it could send notifications for fba shipments too!,5,2
there is no campaign manager...,4,2
excellent seller app from amazon,5,2
great for working anywhere.,5,2
helpful in terms of checking orders and other concerns esp customer's..,5,2
brief view of every aspect .but still good,4,2
the upgrades to the seller app make it an invaluable tool to manage my seller account from anywhere.,4,2
its good to manage while traveling,4,2

good,4,2
good,4,2
easy to navigate. latest update works really well.,5,2
excellent,5,2
"quite easy to use, lots of useful information.",5,2
much improved and much easier to list products from your phone.,4,2
since last upgrade it sends you periodic text messages with amazon security codes to login  its bery annoying and mieading as it gives you impression that someone is trying to access your account fom somewhere. i cant tell whether its my app ot someone else trying to login,3,2
very convenient to manage my order,5,2
best for sellers,5,2
no notifications than tell me you are responding late. what a software engineering!!!,4,2
doesn't properly work.,2,2
absolutely love this. making my job so much easier,5,2
items often appear when scanned but not valid when creating listing on pc at seller central. app otherwise is extremely helpful and easy to use. barcode scanner is excellent.,3,2
"would be 5 stars but it doesn't let me change the notification sounds, which is very irritating. thanks!",3,2
very useful for quickly managing  inventory and selling on my phone.,5,2

supab,5,2

very useful app for sellers,4,2
this is a fantastic app to quickly navigate orders and act instantly.,5,2
it's very useful app. especially after the app was upgraded. i'm enjoying the new possibilities. recommended.,5,2
i'm still getting used to the new ui but this app is very useful with the barcode scanning feature,5,2
very fast and functional.,5,2
this app works great for me! it made listing items for sale amazingly easy. it takes about 1 minute to list an item by scanning the barcode. i wish i had started selling on amazon much sooner!,5,2
user friendly,5,2
sales not showing in the app,2,2
this app is not opening  in ny mobile,2,2
i love this app it works nicely. even better now that i can photograph and list directly from the app!,5,2
check it all the time.,5,2
new ui is very very clean and user friendly...,5,2
works great,5,2
after update better working,4,2
noo,1,2
handy,5,2
"app not working correctly, scanning a bar code or picture items come up as either collectble you have to select in order to see used & new. or it just goes to the seller like you are buying the item.",2,2
after this update it sucks. need option to go back to older version,2,2
pretty soon so for selling on amazon you can literally run your business from a phone. awesome amazon.,5,2
i like the update,5,2
"love this app. lets me check my sales, and inventory . thanks",5,2
not have access!!!!,1,2
"lot of flaws. right now, i can't anwer the messages. i can't even open them on my phone. really annoying.",2,2
i liked the old version better,3,2
"amazing app to keep track of fba sales.  besides management, the app is pretty straightforward on how to use.",5,2
"good app, but fba order details r not there. hope new updates will hv the facility.",4,2
great for my little amazon empire,5,2
not good gui and slow...,1,2
cool app,5,2
best,5,2
works the way it's supposed to.,5,2
essential for your amazon business.,5,2
new update removed some good features. preferred it when you could see how much you were due to receive each payment date.,3,2
great app lets me keep track of my amazon seller account.,5,2
"has some bugs to be worked out. i use this app to sell online, and found that the scanning feature  does not always populate with the correct info, so you need to be extremely careful that you're not listing the incorrect item by mistake. double checking 21 digits of every upc code can really slow you down.",3,2
best,5,2
"helpful, thanks",5,2
the new updates are fantastic,5,2
good app for a quick view of orders...,5,2
the new update seems to be great...,4,2
love it!,5,2
i like it alot. it is very handy for quick overviews of your seller account when ur away from your desk and need to check something quickly or respond to costumer messages.,5,2
works great - easy to understand!,4,2
"more control on my mobile, liked the changes.",4,2
i like it. i think.,4,2

keeps improving.,5,2
very good app,5,2
it's a very nice app. i love the updates which give you a clearer picture of seller performance over time,5,2
"very good app, love the reports.",5,2
new update rocks. getting more and more full-featured; works great for most tasks.,5,2
it could be much better,3,2
liking the upgrades.  wish it showed how many units per month or day sold.,4,2
good app,5,2
it's very helpful there when you need it. if you understand how powerful this app is there's no reason why you cannot be successful in amazon.,5,2
better than any other online company app for seller,5,2
excellent at what it does. only thing thats severly lacking is the ability for the buyers to receive messages and be properly notified. it seems they dont understand how to receive them or when they do they ignore.  an ebay like messaging platform notification system would be ideal,5,2
i like the new version so far.,4,2
i only wish it showed me my seller rating.,5,2
excellent,5,2
nice,4,2
very useful for seller and destination of business,5,2
simply the best,5,2

i like the new update,5,2
great app,5,2
"don't like it after update. still want to filter prefers by today, past week, etc. do like the growth stats tough, shown in graphs",2,2
i like this,4,2
i think overall to use on my phone as a reference for  important info it's perfect. at times it works but sometimes i don't have a lot of luck scanning bar codes and getting the product info that i'm looking for or doesn't have any match at all. . but over all i use it regularly and enjoy it,5,2
"good app, but would be better if it had more functionality from the web such as reports.",4,2
this new update hands down has made me want to leave a stellar review. the reports and analytics is a great upgrade from the basic visuals. they really want to take care of their sellers with as many tools as possible and this update is a great addition.  thanks!,5,2
love the new interface!,5,2
awesome update,5,2
keeps me up to date while out of the office.,5,2
works great. must have for amazon sellers,5,2
terrible i hate the fact that the graph does not show last month against the current month,1,2
not very user friendly as compared to previous version. please do not transition to this updated version. old version is much better all around i must say.,1,2
the new design is an improvement. it's been overdue for a little tlc,5,2
its ok. i was just used to the other version of the app.,3,2
great app for great business.,5,2
still can't upload pictures for listings.,2,2
good app,5,2
very useful and valuable info,5,2
awesome very useful and easy,5,2
thank u to give us such a good platform,5,2
awesome way to stay on top of your business.,5,2
it's really easy to use,5,2

"loved the update. finally, a lot more to do now. however, can't edit the product after the update. please look into it.",4,2
better than website,4,2

i love the amazon seller app because i can conduct business away from home.,5,2
well done,5,2
great app for sellers new version is the best,5,2
this is a great app especially if you are on the move and have a online shop i would advise my friends to give it a try,5,2
good,5,2
waste of time,1,2
simplicity and comprehensiveness with good visualisation.,5,2
cool app,5,2
great for sellers,5,2
well amazon trying to improve this app. i love it to check overview statistics with this app. not sure it it really ready to use as a full replacement for the web interface from pc.,4,2
it is a ok ok update.. it seems they rushed the new update.. previous version had a good interface and was quick to access.. in this options are more but lil confusing.. bars are poorly presented..,3,2
excellent app...,5,2
this is my mobile business and i love itüòçüòä,4,2
this new update is a huge step forward on the data i can get on my phone.  so far i love it.,5,2
easy to use,5,2
don't like the new app,1,2
it needs to be more involved and show more information about sales how much we make and details. give me more information about my account like what i am approved to sell or quick taps that makes it convenient to work and check.,1,2
great app for those who sell on amazon love the barcode scan feature when looking for products to sell on amazon.,5,2
nice and very helpful app user friendly,5,2
fix the issue,1,2
it works,5,2
very helpful to me,5,2
best app,5,2
i love this app,5,2
love the new interface,5,2
way better than the previous version,5,2
"since upgrade, just constantly crashes. unable to use anymore",1,2
works great.  instant notification of communication & sales.,5,2
new version stinks - don't update if you can help it,2,2
superb version,5,2
after the update this app seems to be much more awesome.,4,2
"pictures speak a thousand words, love the graphics.",5,2
nice app to easily & quickly  list the product,5,2
it angers me that anyone can just claim they didnt get the item when tracking # shows delivered and amazon will refund them. whats the point of requiring a tracking number when it clearly is useless and sellers lose money...the seller app is garbage also. too much lag. with. the money amz makes raping sellers it could afford a better quality and more reliable app!,1,2
much better and more useful user interface,4,2
confusing,1,2
great information to keep up with business while on the go!,5,2
no proper bifurcation of payment receivable against each order. and many more flaws.  you can notice the difference when you compare flipkart seller app with this one!,3,2
new updates are helpful,5,2
good job,5,2
a great update!,5,2
very good app,5,2
wow love the new features!! brilliant to have better analysis on our sales :),5,2
"works well in almost every aspect. if the calculation part would default to the average ""cost of purchase"" then it would be a perfect app.",5,2
the update is nice!,5,2
very nice,5,2
love the new update,5,2
"really great app, the recent update added amazing features. i used to use my phones browser to perform tasks but now i can do everything on the app. great sales graphs too!",5,2
"app works good.  great way to track sales, inventory and profits.  i wish it told you which of your items have sold though.  that would be my only gripe.",5,2

"so far, so good.   the updated app looks great and has new features!",5,2
great improvement over the old version.,5,2
"great update, much more useful and feature rich now in comparison. but it is a bit cluttered and will get some getting used to. obviously if you're an amazon seller with a smartphone this app is a must-have.",5,2
awesome application specially for new sellers this will help you a lot to track on your orders where ever you will be you will get the notification of your order and you will be able to manage it from anywhere just with your mobile.,5,2
finally they nailed it!  just about everything you need is on this app,5,2
awesome,5,2
works great,5,2
loving the progress,5,2
handy watered down tool of the seller central account,4,2
good i expect more,5,2
but quantity update not good,5,2
forget about negative reviews. try it tourself. just ensure your phone has enough space for the app and that you reboot your phone beforehand.,5,2
not good,1,2
loving new dashboard üñí,5,2
great tool,5,2
superb than snapdeal and flipkart,5,2
allows quick checkups on my daily sales.,5,2

great new updates,5,2
good,5,2
"i still don't have 100% functionality as i would have on my desktop browser  edit: the feb. 2017 version has more functionality, much better app.",4,2
"it looks good and awesome but if we get the status of order delivery, it's looks still good",1,2
nice aap,4,2
helpful,5,2
more add  fushars  for scan rto received seller,2,2
good,4,2
i love this app. but wish i could have a us option too or have the ability to switch between the us and uk/e markets. love how it is monthly and our reports are 2 weekly - good to see the monthly stats.,4,2
very good app....,5,2
"amazon seller is great! i get notified instantly for all matters, and i can do practically anything that i can do on my laptop or desktop. the app loads fast, so i can quickly manage orders and submit shipments. thanks amazon!!",5,2
great app for a seller.,5,2
good app,5,2
this app is helping nicely to update the inventory and recieved the orders,4,2
don't sell on amazon. they steal your money,1,2
works well for assessing potential amazon items to sell,5,2
"great app to use on the go. very intuitive, a lifesaver.",5,2
"gets the job done, but customer service is bad",5,2
it is handy. but it keeps getting glitches that they don't seem to care to fix.,3,2
it is so easy to use and quick also.  love it!,5,2
very very helpful app. just a few things more would make it best. 1. performance detailed ratings 2. a-z claim reply 3. return order details 4. safe-t claim as easy if in app bcoz of camera in phone,4,2

good,5,2
good,5,2
nice but can add more features,4,2
so far so good.,5,2
much better than it used to be.... getting better with few crashes and better metrics.   i like it - just hope that amazon keeps up its development,5,2
not user friendly. i like the old one better,1,2
ex app was easier to use. i would compare the previous sales. and i can not see asin's as mentioned.,2,2
app market is moving so fast that one forgets 5 years ago this was not a possibility. many many crappy app now days...this one not being one of them...very good for an amazon seller,4,2
awesome application that amazon is continuously improving to make a better experience for the user,5,2
no orders,4,2
works great,5,2
i think it's great and helps me enormously.,5,2
"i am constantly on it, i use it everytime i go shopping or go to garage and yard sales.",5,2
works great,5,2
good,5,2
fantastic seller apps..,5,2
"this app is excellent in identifying restricted products, all lists of fba,mf prices, informations of the current and the past sales and as well as the rank of the item. but, i wish if amazon come up with the fastest scanning device which can be attached to any kind of smart phone for sellers on amazon with fair prices.",5,2
after country selection the screens loads and turns white.i have redownloaded but the result remain the same.,2,2
very good product,5,2
really dislike the changes to the top bar on the homescreen. two swipes now to get to your balance?,2,2
love the new look but keeps crashing when i try to access the sales chart,3,2
easy to handle whole,5,2
fyi i love the changes to the interface. but now it's not scanning with my 4g connection. even with full connection.,5,2
great app easy use,5,2
great app.,5,2
superb app,5,2
it is helpful but it does not always give accurate sales rank information.,4,2
"great app, easy to use.",5,2
"this app is excellent!  it scans books by isbn or the front cover, even from a distance away.  it makes it easy to add to your inventory flawlessly.",5,2
"good but takes a while to update, notifications aren't accurate and marking as shipped is a pain as there is no details on the summary.",4,2
"this is a good app but needs some work. for a start, not showing up in recent apps list. dont know how many times i've switched out to my browser only to not be able to switch back. clicking on the icon from the menu opens the homepage of the app, meaning that the message reply you were writing has been lost and you have to start from scratch. please fix quick!",3,2

good app,5,2
"useful, convenient, time saver, a must have to manage business on the go..",5,2
good,4,2
"the app should also display alerts in case of order cancelation,  buyer messages",3,2
very useful and easy to navigate. but this new version is crashing and getting logged out by itself quite often. just that needs to get fixed.,4,2
is good and helpful,4,2
works well for all the basics. only have to use the pc once in a while to keep the selling process moving.,4,2
good but can improve,1,2
"i like the old version, but was really lovin' the new version. i didn't have any issues with it on my galaxy s7, so hoping they bring it back soon. thanks for all the effort!",5,2
fake,1,2
very user friendly,5,2
i was using the app for a few months and now i cant even log on. cant find any help via net i cant log on for apmost 2 months now im using android system... for such a big company such a terrible app...,1,2

"when it works its great. currently when i sign in i can't see any orders or any messages.  its just a white page, very frustrating!",4,2
the new app crashes all the time.,2,2
"easy to use, i am really enjoying the service of amazon app",5,2
new amazon 2017 update app not working properly.,3,2
works great for at a glance view of your amazon seller acc.,5,2
does amazon seller app really work? i have been trying that since last 2 weeks but it does not proceed after selecting country. is it something only registered users can only login and sign up is not provided over mobile app?,1,2
i'm still orienting myself to this app. it's not 100% user friendly.,4,2
a much needed improvement.  useful information is now readily available.  only problem i've been having is sometimes the app will freeze and i have to restart my phone to get it to work.,4,2
great for quick work but does not provide detailed functions,4,2
data rich and functional,5,2
"i don't review, ever..... this app got me to do it. because it was so great and useful? no. it has to be the worst working app i have ever encountered. i wish i could tell you about all the nifty features and about how much time it saves me as i can easily perform simple tasks as a seller on the run. instead it crashes or won't even start up. it is slow and will not function at all. i now have to log in from a desktop or through the browser on my phone to do everything. this app is now costing me a lot of time, i am not amused.",1,2
the new version keeps hanging a lot. very frustrating.,3,2
worked great until most recent update. i like the changes but it doesn't work.,2,2
great app very helpful and informative!,5,2
this site is good,5,2
absolutely horrible since the recent update. constantly crashes.,1,2
"looks nice but just keeps calculating,  disappointed.",2,2
just keep calculating and does't work its very difficult to work. old one is better than this,1,2
the app is great but the new update has bugs which has it crashing +,4,2
very very easy & useful. must have for amazon sellers,5,2
excellent,5,2
keeps me connected when in trnsit,5,2
detailed informative app.,5,2
"the idea is good. they finally added the ability to see sales compared to last year. however when you select the time period ""this month"" it compares to the entire month from the pervious year even if you are only two days in to the month, which is pointless.",3,2
the new interface update causes the app to crash a lot on samsung 7 phones. you need to test more before releasing. or have a way for the users to revert back to an older version. don't like this new update much.,2,2
still new to me. but its teaching me alot about amazon selling,5,2
excellent and helpful app.,5,2
good work by amazon,5,2
is a good app but it would be great if you can see the fees in the inventory as on the web site,4,2
awesome app. super useful!,5,2

i recently upgraded to beta version but it keep crashing very frequently,3,2
good,5,2
good  on demand info for my business.,5,2
i love the app. the only thing i would  like to have is summary  of the sold products,5,2
"the uneditable flat shipping rate of $3.99 is almost never enough to cover the cost of postage, much less packing materials.  items are constantly disappearing from my inventory for no apparent reason, and with no notification.  the ui is clunky.  i would think amazon would make a better app than this.",2,2
awesome,5,2
very useful. remotely handle my seller central account. its good. keep it up,5,2
has all info at a glance,5,2
tell more about app,5,2
it's perfect!,5,2
this app is best for scan the product and sell on amazon,5,2
i can see more things on this app than i can on seller central portal. love it,5,2
you really have to  double check your pricing.  it is constantly suggesting a price that is way below the buy box.,3,2
it works gteat,5,2
need lots of improvements. very slow on live updates about account,2,2
cant log in .having problem in login app automatically logs out while signing in .,2,2
"great app. definitely could use a few more features that the website has, but pretty awesome still.",5,2
good,5,2
excellent app for b2b needs,5,2
"up to 28 days to get paid, i lost 12.5% to amazon, and 37.5% to shipping....and thats from the total $ charged to the customer.",1,2
to sell you have to give amazon kick backs or free products for them to sell and ship them your entire inventory. other wise 6 months and one sell and then that sell is a scam customer. hell they buy and sell 99% of the reviews.,1,2
simply love the way it works,5,2
doesn't seem to be real time.,4,2
gotta love it!,5,2
pretty good...just doesn't have all features of the main seller account.,4,2

"a good app, but has its limitations.  the worse part, is when scanning multiple items, when you scan a product, the icon to scan another is in the wrong place. it's needs to either be movable or placed halfway down screen.  also, it's not easy to see how many products or conditions are available, just the cheapest new or used.",3,1

superb,5,1
the scan option is really helpful.,5,1
"it's missing some of the more advanced functions that you get on desktop seller central, but overall it's exactly what you need when you're on the go: checking in on shipments, changing pricing, taking a quick look at your sales for the day, or even adding a new listing. looking forward to hopefully getting some more in depth or custom range info and charts available like there is on seller central's reports section, but it'll do.",4,1

hated it the way seller support doesn't help sellers and accepts returns from buyers who are cheaters. amazon seller support doesn't care of the seller return policy and forces the seller to accept returns and make refunds even after 30 days of purchase.,1,1
good app,5,1
sometimes it freezes with my samsung s4.,4,1
hassle free,5,1

it should be more customer friendly and more elaborate,3,1
great apps for seller,5,1

thank you for such a great tool. so easy to use.,5,12
nice,5,12
better after update,5,12
love it,5,12
just makes it so simple to manage our amazon seller account !,5,12
not good interface.,3,12
good,3,12
good for sellers,5,12
sexy app,5,12
"it's all about services , far better than other e-commerce platform",4,12
"great but would love to have access to other miscellaneous features that are currently only available on the full seller central web app.  other than that, this app is pretty solid - it's easy on the wakelocks and my battery, and doesn't need excessive permission.  the builtin photo editor is god-awful though - it complains every single time without fail informing me that my photo is blurry; even though it isn't.",4,12
"makes business easier. you can view sales, sales comparisons, orders with details, communicate with customers.",5,12
functionality is pretty basic. can't really do much with it except check gross income sales. not very useful,1,12
good. ..,4,12
i like how fast you can get in and check on status and respond to customers,5,12
easy to use!,5,12
very easy to use. .,5,12
"very easy to use, simple but very useful options included, making business bigger and simpler...",5,12

nice,4,12
it is a little difficult to navigate through options,4,12
"this is a must-have app for any seller, enabling you to keep an eye on daily sales, compare the current week's performance with the one prior, restock inventory, read and reply to customer queries, as well as a host of other functions. it has an easy to understand at-a-glance layout, allowing you to run your amazon business from practically anywhere!",5,12
"amazon is cheating indian business man, not paying any money after selling on amazon ! holding all the money for future transactions ! pathetic ! unbelievable but true, if you sale for ‚Çπ 10,000 on amazon with multiple products you will getting hardly transfer ‚Çπ 350 in ur bank account !",1,12
great for checking sales from home at a weekend.,5,12
nice app but very less orders,5,12
wowwwww,5,12
"scanning products is fantastic, and the history is essential.",5,12
great app,5,12
üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå,5,12
nice ui,5,12
i used a application when i have to,3,12
essential resource for doing business on amazon.,5,12
helps me manage when i am on the run! i print packing slips and keep track of my business.,5,12
good,5,12
"the application is very helpful and has a lot of the functionality that selling from a computer has. my only complaint though is that you have to be wary of becoming reliant on this app to always inform you of when you have sold a product because there have been a few instances of when someone will buy a product from me, yet the app did not give me a notification until several hours after the sale, and once no notification at all causing me to be late on shipping a product. 99% it works perfectly though.",4,12
works great. easily accessible.,5,12
good,5,12
scanning feature works well.,4,12
great app but somewhat slow,4,12
app is alright; wish it told me what it was that just sold. i have to memorize what's in inventory or look at the web browser version for that.,4,12
super helpful :),5,12
your app not open time waste to install,1,12
relatively easy to use.  new features were common sense.,5,12
slow,1,12
have to use it,5,12
makes selling a lot easier!,5,12
does just about everything,5,12
great program!,5,12
"good app. needs more features like removal order and especially a better way to handle a customer issue on the road. like refunds, etc.",4,12
great app,5,12
easy to use,4,12
great app.,5,12
very good app almost everything done same as panel good one,5,12
great app and works well when wi-fi is good. have not been able to get it to work very well on cellular when scanning. error code each time.,4,12
great for listing. could improve on balance for all selling platforms,4,12
"great tool!! easy to use and manage, very handy on the go, keeps you alert and aware all the time. thanks and please maintain this app.",5,12
great app!!,5,12
very functional,5,12
from time to time there is an issue when identifying hazmat or items that you can't sell.,3,12
excellent,5,12
"great app, does what it needs to do well!",5,12
"excellent app, easy to use, easy to compare prices.",5,12
amazon mobile app is vary good performs & very easy to use it,5,12
easy to work with.,5,12
"dear amazon team here i don't find payment panel as well all offers & minimum pricing, sales growth opportunities etc... need many updates",2,12
it works & the info is very timely,5,12
great for keeping tabs on daily sales and responding to customer inquiries.  works well for my pl business.,5,12
as a seller very easy app .......,5,12

helpful,4,12
i find this app very helpful to my business. it has some good info inside it that i need on a daily basis.,5,12
not bad!,3,12
very limited functionality - this app needs improvement,2,12
it's a excellent app,5,12
gets done quicker.,5,12
good work,5,12
seamless and intelligent software,5,12
right to the point for what a seller needs good job amazon!!! just would have been perfect if it had each product separate function .,5,12
surpassed my expectations!,5,12
they suspend a seller account without clarification or prior warning and do not even respond to your emails. worst marketplace i have ever seen.,1,12
"can i selling , my product,  without tin no & vat no , because i don't have,",3,12
great app,5,12
best app in my mob.,5,12
it's ok for basic operations. need more working app for smooth access.,4,12
good app,5,12
love this app!,5,12
i love how easy this app. is. it is very helpful and you can always keep a eye on your inventory!,5,12
"i wish i could see just the fba offers when listing an item, instead of scrolling past dozens of penny offers. update: the app now warns you an item is a slow seller when you first scan it. much better than previous method of waiting till you bought it, cleaned it up, listed it and then tried to add it to a shipment.",4,12
the scanning feature is quicker than last version and i like the new version with new feature to take  pictures for listing.  make it easier for sellers.  thank-you for continuous improvement.,4,12
works fast and well. i'd like to tap on my products in inventory and go to my  listing on amazon store,5,12
"great app, user friendly. but i feel limited to what i can see in comparison to seller central on a web browser.",5,12
good,5,12
this app cuts off and freezes. updated rating 4 stars: app is better on lg3 versus samsung galaxy s3.,4,12
works great.  the only suggestion i have is there should be an optional alert when you sell an item.  that way you wouldn't have to check the app all the time.,4,12
"does a good job, but provides limited information when researching products.",4,12
allows me to look at and edit a lot if little things.,5,12
"i love the scanning,  the app warns me that item can't be sent to fba or i'm unable to sell. respond to messages is simple and straightforward.  i have access to my accounts email templates.",5,12
still slow,3,12
i unliked it very much,1,12
wherever i go i used it to scan the products and it tells me all the details. it is one of the best app.,5,12
i would really appreciate if the app had access to my advertisement's reports and edit the campaign on the fly.,4,12
good 90% of the time have some issues with scanning sometimes,4,12
this is my go to app for a quick peak in our amazon business operations.  it would be nice if there were more options such as advertising interface,4,12
does everything i need!,5,12
love this app. you can do a lot things with it!!,5,12
i love that i can scan and post very quickly with this app.,5,12
"i think an improvement could be ,being able to print shipping notes from the app rather then having to go to the website every time please",4,12
"excellent app, but you can't see return requests or respond to them from within the app",4,12
very easy to use.  thanks for to being easy for us.,5,12
help full,5,12
very helpful and easy to use,5,12
"can track my daily inventory, orders and fba shipment status. thus app is very handy",5,12
a lifesaver when i am not near my computer.,5,12
would like to see pending orders number on the front page,4,12
gives me all the pertinent info. i got rid of the paying apps and only use this now.,5,12
who could ask for more?,5,12
superb,5,12
nice app,5,12
i love to sell on amazon,5,12
love it,5,12
missing key features,3,12
it's good,5,12
glad to see recent updates have made the app easier to use.,5,12
not happy with it,1,12
"this app is great, it let's you list items for sale direct  from smart phone without having to use a computer",5,12
"you don't get the full functionality as an html seller pannel but is handy when it comes to dealing with the basic operations process, like order alert and managing customer mails, etc. has scope for improvement for sure.",4,12
"love the scanner! listing is a breeze. i no longer need to toggle between two windows. since i take into consideration sellers' ratings as a factor in my pricing, it would be nice to see that info without leaving the app.",5,12
very nice,4,12
it is greet,4,12
large inventory on everything awesome app,5,12
"not as detailed as i'd like, but overall it's convenient for managing orders mobile.",4,12
keeps you up with real time info on sales and payments.,5,12
"i am able to list, message, and check my inventory at the touch of my hand. this is epic.",5,12
its helps out for sure.. i still find myself having to get on an internet browser constantly tho.,4,12
very intuitive,4,12
"has been a huge help to me. no, every product doesn't come up when scanned, and yes the wrong item sometimes comes up as well. i have zero issues with this considering how helpful it has been and i don't have to pay for it! one tip for you, it also has a photo tool which allows you to take amazon ready photos...",5,12
like it mostly. wish it had a few more features. can't see advertising report or change it.,4,12
everything i need to keep track of my sales throughout my day.,5,12
the info displayed on the full website and what is displayed on app is slightly different e.g. pending orders only appear in full website...apart from that it is great,4,12
"getting logged out everytime, need to re-enter my user & pass everytime i use it,   emailed already twice but no response",1,12
"the app help me updated inventory prices when i'm away from my laptop but it's not that great for sourcing inventory. the app is slow and i still find myself using scoutify, or profit bandit. due to the slugging scanning times i'm considering going to fba scan because you can download the database to your phone and work offline. i really hope amazon reads this because i would love to get an offline database feature.",3,12
good ui,5,12
sellar aap,5,12
i can't believe all of the spoiled brat reviews on this very necessary tool for amazon sellers. it is always improving like everything else. it's never perfect in the beginning. lucky for you reading this it's not the beginning. it won't be perfect in the end perfection is impossible when the puzzle pieces are always changing they're fit. if you are a seller on amazon this is a must have tool. it works almost as good as the imperfect website at this point in time. this app makes mobile commerce possible!,5,12
easy to access my seller portal.....,5,12
great app.,4,12
i open and refresh this app several times per day to see what sales i've made but all it shows is # of units and total sales revenue. i'd like to drill down one more level & see what items were sold. i appreciate having the app because using a browser on a phone is troublesome especially seller central.,3,12
app,5,12
can be used in poor or good lighting.shows fast results.,5,12
everything you will need to be a successful amazon seller!,5,12
easy to access,5,12
works well with my amazon store. i like getting the amazon customer communication alerts.,5,12
nice app for amazon sellers,5,12
good app!,4,12
i was waiting for this app for long time.,4,12
love this and use it every day!,5,12
good,5,12
love the scan feature,5,12
it won't download on my note5. i need it .. and it's making me late on a shipment.,1,12
some use others but i stick with the original and it hasn't done me wrong.,5,12
awesome- there's need for improvement though- by asking users what we need.,5,12
does what it's supposed to.  love it.,5,12
"easier than keying all in if it scans. won't let me put ""new"" on my new collectable items. good overall.",4,12
"i click on the tracking numbers and expect to go straight to the usps website. instead it opens my browser where i have to login again even though i can see the whole tracking number in the app. also i would like a small button that says ""match lowest price"". then i'll give 5 stars.",1,12
"i use it everyday. i mostly scan for books, and have no problems.",5,12
lot of features not available,3,12
this app is a huge help for me as a beginner seller. definitely a must for any fba seller as a base foundation to build business.,4,12
"with the access of seller application, it has become easier to schedule picks, measure & compare monthly and weekly sales, reply to unread messages but i wish one could access case log as well with it. every day i receive 2-3 calls from seller support and they always refer to case ids for which i need to login to seller panel making it a little inconvenient.",4,12
it's ok,3,12
helpfull,5,12
good,5,12
awesome tool for amazon sellers.,5,12
im not happy with amazon they use us and kick off when they reap money from our sales.,1,12
great for checking on orders and answering messages as well as keeping on top of prices when amazon inexplicably decide to rip the carpet from under your feet with their pricing policies,4,12
the scan feature is too finicky with camera's without auto focus. i need to rely on this app for work and its becoming intrusive.,3,12
mobile app version has limited functionality. but its good and practical for listing simple items and checking updates.,5,12
great seller hub,5,12
good,5,12
amazon,5,12
"really use full app, the support from seller support team is awesome and cool",5,12
"veey helpful to small sellers to view in short all the sales , keep it up amazon .luved the app",5,12
doesn't update the status properly,2,12
much better then others website s,5,12
it's nice app to monitor sales it works be nice if we can manage advertisement options also.,4,12
"the only thing i can think of that is missing right now is a summary unit and sales numbers from the previous day. knowing the amounts in real time for the current day is nice, but the total for a full day is important but of data.",4,12
the app makes it easy to manage my business when i'm not at my computer.,5,12
very easy to use and saves me a lot of time.,4,12
makes selling online almost effortless,5,12
calling function does not work since last many days,1,12
very useful for sellers !,5,12
the cover scan function is particularly useful.,5,12
great,5,12
love it,5,12
"always makes me happy when i hear the cash noise. everything is good. something to improve on will be the ability to send customers invoices. also how quickly it updates on the mobile app when i receive an order.  many thanks for building this app. makes me happy to see the orders coming in, in real time.",5,12
very useful,4,12
very easy to use,4,12
good.,5,12
its very easy to take a record of all our sell,5,12
this app makes shipping and confirming so easy and convenient.,5,12
best app,5,12
good. i just wish it was possible to access more than one seller accounts from it,5,12
"easy to use, a must have if you're a professional seller.",4,12
best app for fba,5,12
everything needed to review your account or scan in store searching for your next best seller is right here at your fingertips!  love it.,5,12
best app ever built!,5,12
decent,4,12
i preferred it before.  i can't get to my seller settings but good for quick on the go processing for the smaller seller,3,12
gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it lacks the shipping purchase ability.,4,12
without help line call servise site is no more worth ..facing problem .plz resolve this issue u can ..,1,12
great,4,12
good so far.,4,12
terrible app,1,12
"it needs wifi, to work properly. does not give notifications unless data is very strong. also on the app i am unable to see the buyer details. so i cannot reach out to them when needed.",4,12
could be the best from the best,4,12
not easy to seller,2,12
the application is so worse that it doesn't have internet connection in it even if i have an internet connection,1,12
sells good products and brand ones,5,12
good,4,12
does its job. like the white dots feature.,4,12
"the best tool for sellers, just the upc scanner is priceless for any store.",5,12
still the best tool. however. i do not like the how the ranks given can no longer be trusted because it does not give subcategories on ranks.,4,12
good,5,12
helpful,4,12
best application. informative and fast,5,12
nice to be able to keep track of my sales on the road,5,12
simple and easy to use.  have managed to sell several books.  no problems at all!,4,12
amazon seller app very bad.... snapdeal seller app & flipkart seller app - best app,1,12
nice app,5,12
i just want advertising feature in the app.it helps us a lot.  i ll rate it again to five after.,2,12
nice,2,12
the app. is really convenient and easy to access even when your not near your pc or happy,5,12
"it would be nice if we could see the amount reserved like in the ""manage fba inventory"" on the desktop version.",5,12
"useful & free, but takes twice the strokes it should.",4,12
very slow,3,12
love the app.,5,12
super seller !! lol,5,12
gets the job done. its ok.,3,12
easy to use and very helpful.,4,12
very very very bad,1,12

love the continuous improvements,5,12
anyone selling on seller central must have this app. nothing to talk about...an absolute must!,5,12
great and fast,5,12
we can easily earn throgh this.,5,12
a year or so ago there was no amazon seller app available for android. there was only desktop and mobile website access. it was a good decision by amazon developers to make it available to android users. the app is smooth and intuitive to navigate. with quick account access and notifications you can make changes faster than if you would do that through mobile website. it still needs improvements though. one i can think of right now is full management of pricing because you can't adjust sale price.,4,12
"it is good , but some more features could be included",3,12
perfect for managing your business on the move,5,12
does everything you need it to.,5,12
i'm addicted to checking it.,5,12

i'd like to see the items that i sold on this app either weekly or monthly,4,11
"great to view account action 24/7, some minor limitations but really does all you need when you're away from your work station.",4,11
great app for the serious seller!,5,11
not an exact replica of the website - couldn't find case logs,3,11
this app is very easy to use and very instructional,5,11
full features of website are not available on the app. please update it for better user friendly experience.,2,11
previously i had given 5 stars but now app stucks as soon as you select country. tried uninstalling & reinstalling the app but same result. dissatisfied !!,1,11
shuld be more wide with more settings and adjust some foults..,5,11
great tool to accompany me while i am away from my computer. love that it shows me real time activity!,5,11

best selling app i know of,5,11
work as intended,5,11
love that i can tap into my info quickly. very helpful.,5,11
too many features pending,2,11
very friendly and best interface app....,5,11
easy to use but not as functional as i would expect from a multi billion dollar company.,4,11
easily check all things..,4,11
this app is so helpful in my amazon business.,5,11
i love it,5,11
"making a listing is really easy and quick if youre selling something that's already listed on amazon. you can scan upcs with your camera to search listings and your inventory. it takes longer to make listings for items that are not already on amazon, basically to the point where you'd rather get on the computer to do it. the app makes it really easy to change your prices and you can get notifications straight to your phone when your items sell. overall i'm pleased with it.",5,11
good business opportunity,5,11
good aap..!!!,5,11
lovely app user friendly,5,11
good,5,11
"great app and makes the experience a lot easier although there is always space for more improvements. i would have left my five stars, but since the latest update the app just keeps on logging out!",4,11
great  app,5,11
"it is good for posting very simple things quickly, or checking what has sold, but otherwise very limited functionality. can't access my account information, or update or change postings or prices. you would think a company as big as amazon would do it better. a big disappointment. hopefully they will upgrade this so it can actually be used as a tool to manage your selling account and not just an app to see what you sold each day.",2,11
great,5,11
signed up for a seller account on 11/25. it is now 11/28 and it says i am unauthorized to login. amazon charged me $39.99 and i can't even log in to contact seller support. very dissapointed,1,11
easy to use,4,11
it is grrat,5,11
"cannot be flexibile and productive with them mobile app. i need th desktop app, which impacts cta my mobility",2,11

works well.,5,11
"i spend hours on the website uploading, checking prices, and checking shipments. having an app that does the same thing is lovely.",5,11
wonderful free app for az sellers.,5,11
this app helps me fr my business.thanku amazon,5,11
great app for on the go activities.,4,11
wonderful app.,5,11
really useful in deciding what yo sell on amazon,5,11
app makes it easy to check my seller account and respond to buyers messages.,5,11
is likely,5,11
app has less bugs and more features and functionality than before.,4,11
"i am new on this journey and by using this app i have a great companion. it work perfectly, and with image scan you can't ask for more. also accurate details about your item.",5,11
use it daily to see where i stand. it works perfect,5,11
despite lacking the full features.. this app is great for mobile when you just want to check your sales. in addition it has an awesome scan feature which you can use in shops to check for potential products.,5,11
ok,4,11
"it is an awesome app, you can manage almost anything that you on mobile. but it would be great if you also implement a barcode reader in the order search bar. it will help alot when we type in those long order ids.",5,11
i use this app everyday i like it a lot excellent selling tool!,5,11
great at sourcing and managing inventory.,5,11
"much much better than all other competitors ie flipkart, snapdeal and shopclues.",5,11
new order not update and notification.,2,11
excellent,5,11
i find the seller app to be very useful.  however many features are missing in app that are available on web. hence 4 stars.,4,11
brilliant!! very happy and responded when i had an issue. would recommend this app to anyone! thank you so much,5,11

"app not loading/working. had this on my phone and worked fine. then just quit working. uninstall and install, will not load back on.",2,11
works very well and i'd be lost without it. only 4 stars tho as replying to msg can be hard to work out.,4,11
login issue with the new version kindly sort it out,5,11
very good,5,11
i use the app to sell on amazon and i can find everything so easy.,5,11
suraj,3,11
one addition is required. order wise payment should be shown in the app,4,11
its simple n easy to understand n use,5,11
this app is very helpful for the information on your business on the move.  still waiting for more calibrations and other additions.  rest till now it is superb..,5,11

this app is great for scanning and comparing products,4,11
as a seller it does not give you that much info. so great for casual use but not a sellers tool,3,11
excellent for keeping up with orders etc,5,11
very useful and easy to use.,5,11
i found it very useful until it stopped. the other amazon ap has stopped to. re-installed twice to no avail,3,11

the best app i have ever used it's easy and it has pretty much every feature which is there on amazon seller panel . infact everything about amazon is great i really admire amazon alot. i hope this kind of service keeps on going till the end.,5,11
all the text is over itself in one spot.  info missing.   horrible!,1,11
easy to use.  but there is room for improvement.,5,11
"app displays critically needed data when sourcing products to aid decision making. only issue is at times it will tell you that a product can be sold, but fails to then provide the usual pricing and compete information - so you cannot make your buying decision.",4,11
i'm enjoying this tool more than ever!,5,11

excellent app for sellers,5,11
the app has completely stopped working. i've uninstalled it multiple times and still nothing.,1,11
this is a great app to access a lot of useful data from my seller account. i like the fact that is is expanded often to provide better functionality.,5,11

i like having ready access information on inventory etc.  great app!,5,11

i wish i could tell what products were sold that day instead of just the number of products and the amount. maybe i'm missing something but it seems very hard to tell exactly what items were sold or pending. it seems like it doesn't show up until days later. i really like seeing which items are hot sellers though.,4,11

"needs a little more functionality and could be a little more user friendly to be perfect. at first things don't flow like you expect,  it's not as intuitive as i was expecting from amazon. you also might find yourself looking for something that logically should be available in the app,  only to find out you need a browser for full access.",4,10

this simple and easy use app made finding merchandise far easier.,5,10

"the app allows management of my items for sale on amazon. it doesnt fully replace using the full amazon sellers website. it is weak on monitoring if an item sold. no way to see of you have an order without opening the app and selecting orders. many features can only be done on full website. buying postage, changing item description, putting sales on vacation.... otherwise it is a good app to take care of managing sales.",3,10

stops working in the middle of scanning and will not move or do anything have to keep going back into it while i am working. worked fine when i first downloaded it now i keep have issues. app will not let me list my items!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3,9
please add search option in shipment content area of app. when you go to manage fba shipment their is no way to search what goes where when you are under a work order for where it's goind. i'd have 1000 units at a time and it'd be much easier if i can search that particular item up,5,9
nice one,5,9
"nice to see sales but the app doesn't let you see feedback left by customers, which is critical in case a negative feedback",2,9
the app works great and gives me all the info i need fast,5,9
i got an issue while using app that when you enter shipping details in self shipping orders than we don't get option to save.,4,9
easy to use. definitely worth for any retail check,5,9
needs improvement,1,9
makes it very convenient to scan and upload info directly to seller account.,4,9

i have loved selling books my husband died in june last year and this has brought me out of a deep depression that you for allowing me to be a seller i have really enjoyed it,5,9
"this is a great app on which to check your inventory and keep track of sales.  when you're searching for a potential new item to sell, that's where the app gets more problematic.  granted the barcode scanner has significantly improved as the app has been upgraded, but when you want to search for an item by title, that's where you run into problems.  unlike the regular amazon app for customers, you can't narrow down a product search by category, making a product search by typing in words really tedious.",4,9
i use this app several times everyday!,5,9
super cool. lov the updates,5,9
needs many improvements,1,9

very good business platform,5,9
"its a great to to keep up with daily sales, inventory, customer communication and fba shipments. however when it comes to scanning and finding new products, maintaining favorites it's very inefficient. it freezes, doesn't scan, have to scan twice. new features such as adding new listings, extremely cumbersome. in the past this app was very consistent with showing low price and net proceeds on the favorites screen - now it's very random. 50% of the products do not show this information. it's very frustrating",3,9

wonderful and useful application for anyone selling on the amazon platforms in north america.,5,9
"it is amazing the things you do can in this app but it be more user friendly. it should allow you to scan as many items as you want, instead, after scanning a few items you usually have to go back and start from scratch. it constantly tells you you don't have connection (to the internet- even though i have 4g data)  which is a little annoying",3,9

great app!,5,9
"it's easy to use,have all the information to make the right decision, i love it.",5,9
"brilliant app, must have for sellers",5,9
why going in google page then why you created app waste,1,9

not bad at all a lot better then i thought it would be,5,9
nice,4,9
awsome app,5,9
i liked this app except that it didn't link with my regular account. and it doesn't tell me if i scanned the item before or if i already have it listed?? i'm still learning how 2use it :),4,9
"it is not much more than an okay way to keep an eye on things, particularly messaging, even that is clunky. it's free. i keep it on my phone for giggles. bee nice if the sold notification sounded like a cash register. unimpressive.",2,9
useful tool,5,9
perfect to deal with,5,9
great seller app in compare to the other ecommerce portals in india.,5,9
cash on delivery,5,9
great app makes work easy,5,9
makes other apps useless.,5,9
is awesome!,5,9
this app is a must for amazon sellers.  it helps with everything from retail arbitrage to private label to customer communications.,4,9
üòÅ,5,9
order processing made easier,5,9
"it's good to reply to customer queries while u r travelling. but, app has lot of limitations and has many things to work on.",3,9
best bussiness,5,9
"i like the app, its close to make all easier in ways able to listing products and getting orders alert on time. i love this app best user interface experience. thank u for making easier to get solution quickly..",5,9

great app to keep track of sales and inventory while on the go,5,9
that's good....,5,9
such good,5,9
great for replying quickly to messages. use it probably 50 times a day.. the scan feature is a huge time saver.. must have for any sellers,5,9
the scanner is wonderful. worked quickly and i was able to make sound decisions fast.,5,9

it is half of what it should be.,3,9
"i don't know what's changed but after many unsuccessful previous  attempts, i was finally able to download & use this app on my lg vs985 4g lte. seems to work well.",4,9
most disgusting seller app ever. just not user friendly. small time ecommerce apps are a lot better than this stupid app.,1,9
without this app i couldn't manage my inventory prices on the fly every day. saves tons of time!,5,9
lovely app.,5,9
this application makes managing my online store 75% easier.,5,9
perfect app for selling,5,9
phenomenal app!,5,9
thanks amazon.in,5,9
easy to use.,5,9
this app is full of stuff sellers don't need to see on the app and not enough stuff we do need to see. can't view options customers selected during checkout without digging for the info. cant view ur payment account. can't view seller fees. the sale notification should sound like a cash register but doesn't. can't set a vacation setting without deactivating listings - should be able to just push shipping dates back as needed. amazon seller fees are 2 times the fees at places like ebay and etsy. disappointed,2,9
they suspended my account due to a disagreement with a customer and condition of the item. i accepted the return. they advised the customer not to return my brand 200$ product and issued them a refund. the remaining balance on my account was 400$ in which i have not received and it's been 4 months,5,9
use full,5,9
hi. i am having issues with app on s7 edge. when i log in it asks for username and password.  but it keeps crashing and keep repeatedly asking for log in details.  i can log in successfully from my old phone.,1,9
no issues. easy to use. great app üëç,5,9
web site is ok,3,9
fantastic companion  to the business!,5,9
could help me fixing the problem of notifications on android phones,4,9
i am glad amazon got this app up. it's nice to see stats on the fly. i can make changes to listings and update orders. i like the minimalistic design.,3,9
it's an amazing tool to post items.,5,9
only reason i downloaded this was to make uploading photos easier. pointless not to have the option on the listing page. junk,2,9
i like the extra features and access to my email templates.  i haven't explored everything you can do on here but it seems to work well and has more features than the last version.,4,9
the app crashes occasionally but besides that it's an awesome app since it is free.,4,9
load n menu down does not open,3,9
the only good thing about the app is that it enables the user to scan barcodes to list products,3,9
is ok for mobile app. wish i could do more fba shipping functions from it,3,9
its very nice app it shows all detail which is require day to day activity,3,9
not properly work,1,9

this app is a big time saver for me and makes it easy to add products fast to my amazon inventory.,5,9

bug = have to reselect the shipping carrier after entering the tracking number. wish list = photo scanner works more then just with books.,4,9
"the ui is pretty simple and good.. if even for new product listing feature could be added, it will be great!",4,9
it could have a lot more functionality. i would like it if it told me which products sold in addition to just the quantity and monetary amount.,3,9
limited capabilities within this app. i would at least like to have the ability to track fba shipments.,3,9
very easy,5,9
needs push notifications for all sells.,4,9
all are working well,5,9
can't open my account as a seller,1,9
the app is ok but the entire point of the app is to get notifications when your products sell. there are no notifications and they stopped without warning causing several late shipments and affecting my seller rating. amazon has not taken responsibility yet and so the little guy gets screwed.,1,9
easy to load. quick feedback on shipping.  easy to follow transaction s,5,9
love it,5,9

still missing some key features like allowing you to see historical data from previous months.,4,9

the amazon app is extremely user friendly for sellers,4,8
just the basics but nice for on the go!,5,8
nics,5,8
beautiful app,4,8
"i really only use it for seeing (and hearing) sales, but handy for a few other things. a bit limited and you definitely can't do everything but it's the same with most apps like this and better than slowing the device down. you can always go on the seller central website via your mobile browser if you need to do something not possible on the app.",4,8
its very cool apps.,5,8
love the features this app has and how it allows me to monitor my amazon activity.,5,8
this app has been really helpful for me and i really like it.,4,8

its nice to scan items quickly. its still hard to add new products though. editing is not easy and adding pics is about 80% impossible.,3,8

its help to all seller's to creat inventory easily and fast in 2 finger ..but some time leggy so want it better.,4,8
i have gotten the new android 6.0 update and the ap will not install. i get error 505 which is due to the ap not being updated. please fix!,1,8

why are the push notifications on android disabled???,2,8
must have for sellers.,5,8
absolutely fine...,5,8
good,5,8
more stats and options would be great.,3,8
very nice,5,8
the app is great in almost every aspect. however one big disappointment is that push notifications are disabled for android versions. we need to open the app each time to check for new order. would give it 5 stars if push notification feature would be enabled for android versions.,3,8
"works fine for me, no problems so far.",5,8
no crashes,5,8
awesome tool,5,8
"aside from not being able to see camel camel camel data, it does everything i am currently paying for in an app. the listing option is phenomenal and super fast. going to be cancelling my paid app.",5,8
a must have for the dedicated amazon seller.,5,8
seller support sucks,1,8
the app is easy to use  and is self explanatory!,5,8
very useful app,4,8
app crashes every time i open it even with the latest version. no other app is doing this. otherwise it's working well.  the scanning problem is fixed now.,2,8
haven't had a problem yet.,5,8
business friendly,5,8
not so great for scanning using a bluetooth scanner since you must click inside the search bar each time. you can list from it but have to complete most fields from seller central online. some links are accessible from multiple places within the app. some sellers may find that redundant. room for improvement in several areas but only option for accessing your seller info easily.,4,8
my go to app for sourcing. love it.,5,8
"i have been using this app since i started selling on amazon and have not looked elsewhere yet. it has served its purpose and i like that it is linked to your account so you can see what is restricted and what is not. i have it as a 4 instead of a 5 because occasionally, the numbers that come up don't match reality, but not enough to make it a problem. the biggest issue i have is they removed the option to put a sales tax category on your item as you are listing it so now i have to go to the site to add it.",4,8
very good but today's order is not getting refreshed.,4,8
user friendly interface. it's fast and responsive.,5,8
one of the best apps i have seen to help your business!,5,8
selling is really easy. 10/10. highly recomended,5,8
gud,5,8
"nice to have to check and monitor your amazon business, and keep track of sales.",5,8
its perfect the only problem is it does not give you the custom range data on your sales. likr you cant choose to see the sales from a specific date to another,4,8
app is too poorly designed and managed. user is never able to visualize the next possible screen,1,8
couldn't live without it. everything you need to track your amazon business.,5,8
"works great, but missing major component for sellers, doesn't show list of sellers to see who's prime or not, just lowest price.  also hopefully sales reports will be added as you can't tell what you've sold.",4,8
i loved using this app,5,8
thank you nice update,5,8
quoted low price but not showing in amazon web page.,1,8
"this app makes it very easy for my company to stay on top of inventory, quickly review orders, and analytics. strongly suggest the download for amazon sellers.",5,8

no campaign manager.....  and app is very slow.....,2,8
good app,5,8

"great for basic account, info, scanner takes way to long to focus on barcode",4,8
ggggggggggggg,5,8
great app to see your biz on the go. the new scan feature is good but since the update it isn't very fast and often 'hangs' not showing details,4,8
whenever i go to push notification settings..i get a message tht we are unable to authorise your email and kindly logout and logic.,2,8
love the scanning technology..,5,8
convenient tracking on my phone of my business,4,8

i was pleasantly surprised when i opened the app a few hours after setting up my seller account. what i found was over $300 in sales on a fresh account that was literally opened today. it just works apparently. can't beat selling that much while cooking chicken on the grill.,5,8
awesome app for sellers while on the road.,5,8

it's great to have when sourcing. could be a little more user friendly. have had days when it really doesn't want to work which can be very counterproductive.,4,8
love added amazon flow. but barcode scanner needs to be easier to get too!,4,8
using amazon seller central has been most difficult thing compared to etsy and other shops. their customer service is horrible and when people write reviews it's not clear to anyone if the review is private feedback for the seller or an actual ranking to be published.,2,8
love this product. have been waiting for something like this for a long while. makes it easy to keep on top of sales on the go.,5,8
the only aspect missing out is a payment tab showing payments made along with order id,5,8
"in the first day i sold 7 books,  simple and easy",5,8
blows ebay and etsy app out of the water,4,8
love this app.,5,8
it's very good and also totally useful app,5,8

the only thing missing is the advertising tab.,4,8
mst h yr,1,8
"as every app, it can have a few more operations that can only be done from a browser (like creating shipments and buy the following ups postage) but this app already fulfills a lot.",5,8
good but needs improvement.,4,8
"i'm new w/app still learning features but, so far so good.",4,8
nice app,5,8
great app that provides a quick snapshot of my sales & inventory.  simply love it. üòÑ,5,8
helps me as a seller scan whatever i need from my cell phone. it's awesome.,5,8
great,5,8
"if it is not broken then why not leave it alone! i am so frustrated with the new updates.  it takes forever to scan if it works at all.  this is a critical feature,  and for it not to work makes me question my value as a part of the amazon team and whether this is the beginning of the end of what was a decent working relationship. fed up. put it back.",1,8
i like it these app,5,8
üëåüëåüëå,5,8
awesome,5,8
this app has really helped during my first week of fba.  it's great to be able to scan a potential product and determine its likelihood for being profitable.  the one thing that could use some work on the app is making it easier to tell exactly what had sold from your inventory.,4,8
"i find this app really good, to monitor your seller account when you are away from the office or computer. also very good to quickly respond to any messages or deal with small issues.",5,8
very easy to use,5,8
"app is lighter and easy to work. instead of provide all features and make the app heavy, given only the necessary option.",5,8
if i try to scroll down it takes me to new page... even poor service fr amazon n there third party prione,1,8
"works well. would be nice to be able to check the status of inbound inventory from the app. also the option for sounds when a sale is made (but optional, as higher transaction sellers may find this irritating). no stability issues on my android phone.",4,8
great,5,8
awesome,5,8
would be good to have payment details on this as well.,5,8
had it for a week first day everything great- now it's glitchy. getting hung up on the listing item for sell portion. please look into it- tia,3,8
app is make your work easy special on sunday,5,8
good app,4,8
a must have when shopping. it does however tend to freeze or slow is slow to calculate information.,4,8
works for me.,4,8
this seems to be a very cool app but it lacks a scanning feature so that you could just scan a barcode to get the information. and i cannot find a video or movie or dvd category if i want to sell my movies.,2,8
"it really is a great app for beginners or people just not wanting to do your regular garage sale and have all that stuff around when you could sell it off as you need! still needs a bit of work that's why only four stars, could be a bit faster and sometimes doing to much will overload it and make it shut down.",4,8
please call back me because i can't do my  step 5  but actually i also give to your seller support but plz cooperate,3,8
"for some reason i cannot get push notifications for sales on this android device. this has already caused an order cancellation because i expected to be notified of a sale via the app, and so was not checkibg the email associated with the account. please fix this issue for a 5 star rating.",3,8
deadly app have been using for a wile and still think it is deadly. would be great if you could list straight to f.b.a shipping plan,5,8
amazing,5,8
nice app. but add a new product feature will really make it the best,4,8
convenient,5,8
"this is a good app, but as always with amazon, they could find ways to make it better for sellers.",4,8
great app does exactly what it says on the tin :)) √ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó,5,8
easy and useful,5,8
app does not shows messages in communication..,3,8
very slow to load.,3,8
nice,5,8
great app that works well for me. i get notified when orders come in and can respond to customer queries on the go.,5,8
it's not as good as it could be. when selling multiple items you should be able to see lowest price and if you are that on all products at once. can't be done on this app. other than that it's pretty useful.,4,8
very useful 4 me and my team,5,8
"good app, however there are sometimes delays on placed orders showing in the app. i get email to say an order placed, on the app it shows up that there is a sale today, but if i click on orders to view its not showing the order placed. but if i log into online account it shows ok. sync issues need sorting out. i don't have any issues with wifi or data allowances so it's not that and this has happened more than once. i am using a moto g3.",2,8
good,5,8
easy to  make a listing to update your inventory and of course upload images,5,8

not as much user friendly as flipkart,3,8
you can't monitor ppc.,3,8
it's a great tool and very helping..  customer support is excellent,5,8
"this app can be slow at times, but i would not be without it. it is sxtremely useful for amazon marketplace, and i am no longer only able to manage my seller account from my computer. thanks amazon!",5,8

app is good with improvement but should give us an option for sellers to live chat with customer.,4,8
"i'm extremely thankful for this app, but the most recent update doesn't work properly. for example it won't load product pages at times unless i restart the app. the app also will also scan something but then the app won't search for the product. it just goes back to the product search page.",3,8
huge help!,4,8
"if you sell on amazon, you need this app.",4,8
helps to keep me in the know with my products.,5,7
the new scan may be better for image recognition but i find it more problematic for scanning barcodes.,4,7

"this app is a great selling app, and the fact that it is free is a definite bonus. however the most recent updates seem to be causing some issues. my screen will go completely blank, and i will have to exit out and go back into the app multiple times to try and get it to work again, and sometimes that doesn't do the trick either. lately it has been very rare for me to be able to look up an item without it freezing up first, and this is after the most recent update that was supposed to fix this issue.",2,7

to update product condition login is required in website. also pdf for invoice cannot be downloaded from the app.,2,7
could improve,4,7
it needs the product link (web page view) in the inventory view. would make life really awesome :) thanks.,4,7
this is f***** awesome.  if you don't think this is awesome it is because you don't know awesome,5,7

very nice,5,7
"so i wiped my phone and now when i go to install it, it won't. error code -505. google search was no avail. also i have adequate space left on my internal storage. it wouldn't install the newest update before i wiped my phone, but the app worked. my android version is 6.0 and my brothers phone android 5.4 installs and uninstalls and reinstalls and updated without this problem.",3,7

sales stats are good.  but it would be better if the comparing number would show (for example today's sales vs.  yesterday's sales) in addition to the graph.  as of now only today's numbers show,4,7
very useful app...,5,7
"updated review for 7-19-2016: just downloaded the update with the supposed fix for the scanning bug, still doesn't work. the scan function just freezes on the lg optimus f60, making this app useless for scanning.",1,7

this app is all you need to get your amazon  business started,4,7
easy to use and very good accuracy. correct about 98% of the time.,5,7
this app not only lets you know how well your doing but it helps you make money nonstop from scanning to listing to sales.....easy to use. cache needs to be cleared out if you use it like i do every 3 days. besides that its a superior money making tool! need buy box consulting get a hold of the buyboxgurus!,5,7

very goof,5,7
"this app is very easy to use, even for beginners.",5,7
k,3,7
great app for my amazon bussiness,5,7
very useful when you are on the go and just not next to a computer. some added functionality would be welcome like adding shipping confirmation directly in the app.,4,7
i don't know what i would do with out this. there are a few features that i would change about this but still a necessity if you are just starting out with selling on amazon.,5,7
nice and functional app,5,7

quick reference for most of the items needed. very useful app.,5,7

super a+++,5,7
works well.  i am brand new and will probably have better feedback once i have used it more.  easy to post simple listings.,4,7
serves as said,4,7
could use a link in the inventory  listing to take you back to the amazon listing so you can see the competition. this helps to re-price items competitively without leaving the app.,4,7
i loveamazon.in,5,7
amazon should also add another feature where sellers can get the price breakup which is to be given to the seller.,4,7
nice app,4,7
good to keep track of items sold and in stock.,5,7
good good,5,7
keep it up amazon.,5,7

i love this app. :-),5,7
faxuma kadir,4,7
"i would give a 5 star rating if only the app didn't freeze up every time i go to review my ""favorited"" products. does just fine with everything else.",4,7
the app is amazing but i feel that we can do better with search filters and at time scanner won't pick out the product.  better to update the same software i don't think so it should be rocket science for amazon back end development team considering the percentage  if profits and business they are handling with each category,3,7
use this daily for my fba business.,5,7
problem in notifications,4,7
"great work team, as a seller it makes my job so simple n always on my fingertips.",5,7
when it works well it's great. sometimes glitches where it won't go to the next page or just gets stuck. like the fact it tells you about restricted products.  very easy to read and get info.,4,7
easy to use,4,7
fast easy to use,5,7
it works well but some features i can't use since i am not a big seller. other than that i feel safe enough to sell and buy on amazon. i also feel that there is not enough arm and leg room. too many chief's and a not enough warriors. for me i buy and sell a select handful so i  am pickky?,3,7
do not make people cheet,4,7
easy and simple to use app.,4,7

very easy to use and get the information i need,5,7
"hate the flow takes forever...what happened to red laser scanner, much quicker bring it back please",1,7

"i need to be able to see and tweak my ad campaigns as well as see my sales not only for the current day, but for any selected period of time.",2,7
very useful ....,5,7
generally a awesome app. but sometimes (even with good internet) it will not correctly leaf the graphics or information.,3,7
i think it's great for beginners that can't afford the other scanning software.,5,7
it would be great if i could see pictures next to sold items on ship orders page.,3,7
good functions with sales report and order detail.,5,7
never again,1,7
love it,4,7
"rocking a galaxy note5...works great for me, only issue i've had is when it's loading up your inventory, it can take a bit to load up if your signal isn't strong...definitely a important app to have..",5,7

it's been a great help and i just wish it would show more post when you scan most of the time it's just 1 or 2.,4,7

best game ever lol,5,7

"well i love it to a point, it doesn't show what sold or what got returned you have to go to the main site,  even then it is not  simple, it's just complicated for no reason it could be a lot simpler. don't get me wrong i love amazon.",3,7
has great info but constantly freezing and i have to close it and reopen,3,7
"very useful. no need to pay for other scanning apps if you have an up to date smartphone.  ability to edit listing service has been added.  change pricing, update inventory add images track fba shipments and more. 7/11/16 image upload not working for me since last update",4,7

useful,4,7
"great app, works great. can run my whole business on this app. wish it had more tools to figure out payouts and things, but i'm fine with resorting to website for more detailed info.",4,7
good app to access your seller central account. love the new integration with amazon flow. 2 thumbs up.,5,7
not working for amazon uk. i have been trying to scan all the stuff i can get my hands on and its not working. i've scanned my razer abysus gaming mouse and it doesent show any on the market but if you search on website there is plenty for sale.,1,7
app wouldn't update so i uninstalled to reinstall. app will not download.,1,7
nice......,5,7
it works well for me to use as a tool to keep track of what is going on.,5,7
this app has been very easy to use in starting up my business. the scanner component makes it very easy to research products to sell.  getting notifications from sales and buyer inquiries is most helpful as well.,5,7
plz see flipkart app. then u will find that how the app. should be looks,2,7
"its a small learning curve, but for the most part simple in posting and shipping products.",5,7
great app and a must have for amazon sellers,5,7
"i use the app for quick check-ins on my business and monitoring sales & inventory on-the-go. it doesn't have all of the amazon seller central features, but enough to monitor",4,7
i love this app. it makes selling products so easy.,5,7
takes to long to scan and sometimes doesn't work.,4,7
this app is easy to navigate and also easy to sell on amazon.,5,7
chicken,5,7
it helps me check my sales and communicate with buyers effective. even growth opportunities are good in this app like sell a product tab. however i fail to understand the payment tab here as well as on the webpage,4,7
show error 505 for s6 edge plus,1,7
freezes up constantly when scanning,3,7
i think the app is good but still needs a few fixes and i am sure amazon is working on making it the best app possible.,4,7
excelent,5,7
just what i wanted .a portable account manager to manage my orders and prices .i found that in this app where almost anything can be done. improvement should be done in the communication section where we can communicate easily with the customer. also regarding fba shipments it should be automated,4,7
after after scanning a couple products it just stops doing anything i can't go into the settings or anything else it won't show me the pricing information i have to restart my phone and start all over again,1,7
like it. works perfect on my phone,5,7
works for what i use it for.,4,7
supperb,5,7
app,4,7
app is very easy to use and list products really impressed,5,7
order checking is very easy,5,7
straightforward and simple. lets me keep working on the go.,5,7
"lost scanning, substituted with camera which isn't welcomed in many situations, if it ain't broke please don't fix!",2,7
features present in web should be added,3,7
sunil jain,5,7
"scan a book with this. if it's $4, scan a better book. ok that one costs $10. it costs $5 to ship and sell a book. use this app to decide if you want a free book or not.",5,7
latest update as of today errors on install with a 505! getting to be a real issue now since i need this app. wake up amazon developers! this is on an lg g3 with pure stock marshmallow and no other apps except amazon apps have had this issue!  update. response on other amazon app that links this to being an issue with the audible app not being updated. i do not use audible. first thing i do when i get a new phone? disable or remove every app i do not use. audible is one of those. trying to hold me hostage to keep the audible app enabled so enjoy your one star. fix this!,1,7
the best,5,7
could be better,5,7
"great app. although lately when i scan a barcode, it makes me scan twice to actually pull up the product. android s4",5,7
not doing any partiality between sellers.,5,7
i check this app 100 times in a day.we can got the order first in app.very useful give pleasant mind also when we saw a order.,5,7
to clunky and to slow.,3,7
"pay, pay, and pay some more. for all of the amounts that we pay you would think that amazon would give us some better yet more flexible tools. this app lacks that special umph as well as the simple addons that other apps like scan power and fbascan have included with them. one very important thing that the app really needs is the ability to print a barcode label directly to a dymo thermal printer--this would be a huge time saver for us. 2nd thing is the ability to do rapid scan with a mobile scanner.",1,7
great app for sellers. would have given 5stars but app sends you to web site to do a lot of things that you should be able to do from app,4,7
no printing options in orders management,1,7
never knew this stuff was so easy... makes everything a breeze..,5,7
"app is great for  quick access to check your sales, and stay connected to my business.",5,7
need some kind of notification when making sales...other than that good app.,4,7
i do not hate this app. have used and relied on it completely x past 18 months. the past 3 weeks have been a nightmare! don't know what has changed or updated but nothing is working consistently. get a white-out screen with no information on it constantly. cannot back out of the screen to refresh have to close the app completely start all over this happens every other item. and not on just one phone but two. a note 3 and a motorola x pure. i have taken screenshots and i'm going to submit to support.:0(,1,7
easy to use,4,7
it sucks,1,7
very difficult to work with. it could be for anyone but the sellers. prone to hanging and very restricted functions. i wonder if it is only for india like this or its us counterpart is also the same.,2,7
hello sir i want to suggest you to plz promote new products because there are so many seller who offring best quality products and new desgien but due to low visibilty customer can not find it or order it so plz add some fetures that every products are shown in first page of every catagory for some times also add some fetures that randomly evry products shown in first page so customer can view it easily,1,7
"exellent, but not working without internet",5,7
error code 505,1,7
vary bad image quality,1,7
most of the stuff you can get my logging on to seller central. nice additional starts on sales. easy way to keep on top of messages on the move. the only down side is i can't find an option to silence/remove the push notifications. the novelty of the sale noise does wear off.,5,7
‡§§‡§®‡•Ä‡§∑‡§ï,5,7
the scanning feature really needs improvement. many listings are inaccurate and half the time barcodes won't even scan. this is the biggest downfall of app.,3,7
the new photo scan works sometimes but not all the time.  overall it's a good app.,4,7
recently started to freeze and give a blank white screen.,1,7
confusing to scan with.,1,7
good application for sellar,5,7
samsung galaxy grand -2,3,7
wow really easy work,5,7
good,5,7
"needs a few more options like shipping settings and google cloud print support for lables, other wise perfect",4,7
i only use it to source and price items,5,7
"good app, but needs some development on product wise sales summary.",4,7
great app.,3,7
this app works really well with the exception of the reply to messages tab. you should be able to attach files to a message,4,7
awesome user friendly,5,7
"this app makes it easy to add new inventory, as well as updating shipping info. the scan feature makes finding matching items a cinch!",5,7
good app,4,7
almost perfect,4,7
i only use a few features and the app always works great.  mainly use it to check orders and communicate with customers.,5,7
is a great tool but it has become useless since update. freezes every time i use it. needs an update immediately.,1,7
need improvements in ui .... when a small players can build better ui i expect amazon to be at a different level altogether..,5,7
"for some reason, my alerts were disabled and i know i did not do it. please help!",3,7
basicmante tiene todas las funciones escenciales. solo q esta un poco lenta... pero es mi gran herramienta,4,7

good so far,4,7
great app,5,7
great,5,7
easy to use,5,7
nice app,5,7
user friendly and very handy using it for the first time made me feel as if selling online was so easy and i used to think it's a tough task,5,7
good statistical data and analysis,5,7
the app is quite helpful and updated too.,4,7
best aap,5,7
super awsome,5,7
it's easy and helpful all in one.,5,7
good app but would love access to forums through it,4,6
great,5,6
need to scan items multiple times. but great app!,4,6
excellent and a must have for sellers,5,6
works fine no problems,5,6
what a fabulous app this is! i loved the update where you just point at something and it identifies the item in most cases.  thank you,5,6
i am satisfied,4,6
koutoooooooooo,5,6
missing a lot of features,3,6
thanks amazon,5,6
"would give higher rating, but often find when scanning and searching products, often hangs up and leaves me at a blank page, same when trying to look at further details on a scanned item. clicking on the item for details and gives a blank screen with a sell product header at the top, as if it is frozen.",3,6
would love a sound on it though to let you know there is an fba sale,5,6
i do really well with this app. listing items is so quick with it.,5,6
enjoying checking on my business without being in front of my computer all the time.,4,6
it keeps me up to date on my sales and inquiries.,5,6
bretty gud,4,6
nice app,5,6
app interface works smooth. if only amazon could lower their fees a bit! ;),4,6
good,3,6
"love the scan function, and it continues to have new modifications that make it even better! easy to navigate. have not been able to find a way to access recently sold inventory listing in it, which would make it perfect.",5,6
very helpful!!!!!,5,6
like it almost love it,4,6
"i love the fba seller app, it has great functionality,  but is laggy and crashes.  the same app on ios is far superior. great potential to be great though!",4,6
very good online platform,5,6
very easy to use,5,6
excellent,5,6
for those of us who get tired of endless back and forth everything in one app for sellers is genius!,5,6
"simple, easy to use. doesn't have all features of website, but enough to monitor and see quickly what's going on with my business and sales.",5,6
it works from a to z truly.,5,6
"very easy to use, i love it!!!",5,6
uae all the time.,5,6
easiwto use,5,6
"missing a few features but great for on the go. stay up to date. check inventory, orders, and payments.",5,6
it takes too much time to load  often irritating,3,6
your taking money out of people's account without consent,1,6
the app works great but it needs more features so i do not need to use my laptop as often. i wish i could change sale prices - look at and edit campaigns - see more sales statistics.,4,6
"best app by amazon, just loved it!!",5,6
great,5,6
some of the books it does not recognize.,4,6
i'll be ordering whenever i need anything.,5,6
"could do more, but good at what it does",5,6
amazon app suprb. this is very help full  and very easy app so i am very happy with this app.,5,6
keep improving.,5,6
not good,1,6
"this app is pretty efficient. however, when i enter an item on the website, i can see how many items are sold at the lowest price, and decide if i want to go for a higher price based on the low number of similar products, or stick with the lowest price already offered by others. with the app, there is no such link and info. i recommend adding this option to the app.",3,6
"very solid and user friendly, just wish it let you access more things, like your pending paychecks, ect",4,6
just disappointed with the app. it should make selling on amazon easy but if i want to use amazon i will need to post from my computer. it must be completely recognizable for the app to work.,1,6
"we have used this app a lot lately and some times when we scan things at the store,the amount it says it sells for isnt the same when we get home.another thing is,if it were faster,it would also be better.faster scanning is key.",4,6
"makes selling onlune so much easier!  great app, very user friendly!!",5,6
with amazon's resources this app should have more functionality.,3,6
can't see not having this app. love it,5,6
seller friendly app...,5,6
"this app allows you to keep track of your amazon business on the go and is pretty useful to make changes when you are out of the office, that said it's not perfect but hopefully they will keep developing it.",4,6
this app has been very helpful to me in starting up my amazon business.,5,6
this app is 1000 times better than desktop site of amazon..life is easy with it,4,6
"cannot update sale price, only mrp can be updated. feedback manager should also be incorporated",3,6
it makes selling so much more easy. it's really convenient when i need to check my account or confirm shipments.,5,6
nyc,5,6
awesome app for the avid amazon merchant!!!!!,5,6
slightly confusing in orders whats today's orders is different than what the value shows in sales,4,6
"this app is good for sellers but there are many such things which are lacking to become best app such as we cannot view our old remittance, it only display unites sold but doesn't show which products got sold, it doesn't show return products and its condition for fba returns",4,6
can't install,1,6
awesome,5,6
"prices when scanning are way off. scan a book, app shows  $7.50, actual selling price $3.50 as well ss higher rank. users beware. new version is slower with even more issues. scanner locks up, details not working.",2,6
like apps,5,6
app needs a lot of work...would have expected more from amazon,3,6
tracking should be given to the seller in the app also.,4,6
"this is good for checking and replying mails, orders.  need improvement on editing products",5,6
its the best app to sell products online,5,6
great when out and about but would be better if it also showed returns azs and chargebacks,4,6
"a very good app for keeping track of the products you're selling on amazon. it's very easy to add products to sell as well. i wish i could see the condition notes of other products, as i can on desktop.",4,6
best seller's app!,5,6
"minor flaw #1 -- in its ""continuous scan"" mode for barcodes it sometimes (about 10%) of the time submits a guess without fully focusing and, not surprisingly, ends up wrong. minor flaw #2 -- when an item is not eligible for ""fba"" (ie, fulfillment by amazon) it can confusingly look like you can list it for fulfillment yourself, but you can still click ""sell"" and indeed list it for fulfillment by yourself.",4,6
loved it,5,6
account suspended without info and payment not recived. don't sell here,1,6
"very useful for keeping and eye on shipment, sales,customer messages...a must for any amazon seller!",5,6
good,5,6
yes,5,6
good,4,6
easy to use and a big help when you are out and need to check your account quickly or scan a book.,5,6
the seller app has the essential information and data you need to list or research a product. you don't need to spend extra money to purchase 3rd party app when you have one for free. specially for beginners.,5,6
help in terms of getting most of the detail,4,6
good,4,6
better than previous versions,5,6
"this version is much faster than previous versions & much more stable.  now if it would continously scan with my bluetooth scanner, i would give 5 stars.",4,6
"when i take a picture of a new item i get ""the required field main is empty"".   i do not see a place to set this when taking a picture. can't add item!",3,6
all you need is this app for ra and thifting,5,6
this seller app is the best i have ever tried!!,5,6
"new scanner is crap it doesn't work with barcodes. scan- nothing found, enter barcode # by hand found.",1,6
amazon have no rights to use indian  god's photo on random things as they want,1,6
great tool to determine profitability for fba.,4,6
best selling app,5,6
convenient way to keep up on orders and messages from customers.  love the quick month comparison of sales,4,6
thx to make easier to handel my shope,5,6
"i don,t like it",3,6
the new scanner is great and saves a bunch of time.,5,6
nice service,5,6
very useful!,5,6
"on my note 5, it works very briefly then freezes for scanning.  other functions of it seem to work consistently.",2,6
superb application,5,6
helpful,4,6
this seller app is very uesful for completing most routine work. best among all ecom seller apps.,5,6
have to scan everything twice,2,6
we can't  see net payout in the app. no link given for the product.,2,6
works very well no bug's,5,6
not match in info with main site,2,6
thanks,4,6
simple and easy to use.,5,6
"awsome app, just ad payment option too",4,6
great for  amazon sellers.,5,6
lots of info. could flow a bit better.,3,6
"makes it easy to keep up with sales, adjust inventory, and select product.",5,6
"straight forward app, easy to use and very clean",5,6
much easier,5,6
works great so far.,5,6
overall this is a very useful app. there are many improvements that can be made. it is updated regularly with improvements and new features every time.,4,6
looking a brand items in this app so this app very usefull to shopping.....,2,6
great tool for sellers,5,6
good,5,6
easy to use. only downside is scanning items sometimes freezes.,4,6
good app,4,6
very much easy to use.provides all the info and we can easily get the work done,4,6
pretty good.,4,6
cool concept. no so cool execution. app is riddle with error messages.,3,6
"if you're an online seller, you have to make use of this app to grow and expand your business.",4,6
does exactly what i want everytime and gives me the information i would have to pay for in other apps.,5,6
great for retail arbitrage. love the camera scan feature too!,5,6
this is finally really helpful to our business and very quick to check or do simple tasks.,5,6
amazon app as well as all process and policies are very much seller friendly,5,6
ceo,5,6
very very nice and easy to work on makes work load easy,5,6

makes my work really easy. helps me easily manage my store on the go.,5,6
"it's efficient, and is easy to figure out.",5,6
great app.. a suggestion - we need a simple report which shows the sales for a period and the closing inventory,4,6
good work,5,6
it has all the things. too good and gets updated on realtime.. thanks amazon,5,6
great app.  makes life very easy has a merchant,5,6
needs work but like it.,4,6
order features needs to be changed,4,6
love it!,5,6
useful scan app and complete service for all my ships to fba^^,5,6
makes keeping track of the sales on a mobile device simplified.,5,6
very good  apps,5,6
does what i need it to do.,5,6
this app would be complete if it had a sale notification alert instead of me checking it all the time to see if i had a sale today;(,4,6
i'm not familiar with other apps like this but this is a great design to track low inventory. one can easily follow-up with customers.,5,6
it will be grt if we can schedule an appointment and print the labels from the app itself,4,6
just learning how to use this app. great when you have a very good signal. hope you will include in the sales today the list of items sold.,4,6
easy to use all information on seller dashboard...,5,6
could be improved to let you know which products have sold and not just how many products in total. but over all i have not real concerns and it works fine for me.,5,6
the only thing i would add is an alert to let you know when an fba item sold.,5,6
especially if you need to work remotely...,5,6
good,5,6
been using ebay and it's broken systems for years and getting tired of it. amazon app and seller systems are a breath of fresh air!,5,6
great,5,6
love this app. saves me time . thanks,5,6
"useful,when it's working - this app is very unstable. crashes/hangs often, usually after looking up half a dozen things, then i have to close and restart. clearing the cache seems to help. info is sometimes contradictory, with prices on the results page different from those on the detail page. i will be trying some of the paid apps, this one isn't reliable enough.",3,6
super easy to use app,5,6
wish it had fba selling shown,4,6
easy to use....,5,6
quick and easy time saver. great app!,5,6
very misleading,1,6
easy to use,5,6
grt experience ... still scope for improvement,5,6
great,5,6
this app has come a long way since it's introduction and is now a great tool even though there is still plenty of room for improvement.  good job amazon!,5,6
"amazon's app is good. but their service is marvellous. reasonable marketplace prices. there is an option for sellers to avail self shipping. this feature makes it good for sellers like me who are from small towns and villages. i like their fee structure. in order email i always receive the exact remitted amount for my sales where flipkart sucks in this case. talking about the app, it's good to know about new orders instantly. it even allows to list the items that are already available on the marketplace.",5,6
"crisp and light, serves most purpose needed from mobile.",5,6
very usefull and easy to use,5,6
easy and convenient,4,6
sale and inventory management comes handy..please add advertisement info tab also..,4,6
perfect,5,6
good for basic functions,4,6
all the information i needed right there at my finger tips as i shopped!!!,5,6
makes arbitrage easy on the run.,5,6
easy to use,5,6
fast searching via barcode scan also does image searching,4,6
just needs to be more versatile.. for real time inventory and pending order check list,5,6
ultimate seller app seen till now,5,6
"great app for the seller. makes the process so easy. love the scanner app, just needs to be a little consistent scans",4,6
"great useful app. could use a few tweaks to be perfect. the sales and units sold, at the top of the app, when clicked, should give complete item info of what was sold, not just a graph. that's not helpful. second, the visual search is good, but always incomplete when searching movies. for example, it only shows the dvd result instead of all possibilities, dvd, vhs, blu-ray, etc. tweaks!",4,6
for some reason when i b sale something it does not notify me unless i am doing something wrong and the app is down 30% of the time....,3,6
"if you have an amazon business, this tool is indispensable.  seamless integration with your amazon account, has sales figures, inventory, pending sales, ability to sort and search current and even out of stock inventory.  all tools a serious seller needs and wants to keep track of their business!  i wish it had active tracking on inbound shipments so you can see exactly where your product is along the way, but it does have closed status when shipment is to amazon and processed.  great job guys!!",5,6
i'm addicted to this app,5,6
awesome zone,5,6
need work on inventory management,5,6
superb,5,6
easy to use,5,6
easy & simple,4,6
visual search is not very accurate!,4,6
"smooth, seamless operation. works great.   able to track sales and inventory from anywhere.",5,6
great seller tool,5,6
wonderful tool for amazon sellers,5,6
"i really like being able to get my sales info for the day, check order status and invntory. this is probably my favorite app.",5,6
really good app for quick response to customers.,5,6
i loved this app before they added the visual scanner. it has not gotten a single scanned item right yet. waste of effort. go back to the drawing board.,2,6
"this is a great free app for scouting and managing amazon sales. i use it to check prices, list items, check sales, and more. i haven't used any other sales apps so i don't know how it compares with others.",5,6
great application. easy to use.,4,6
the scanning app i use the most. love the new feature that scans a picture of the item when there is no barcode or the barcode doesn't match the item.,5,6
this app makes it easy to scan products quickly and find the amazon listing for profitable evaluation.,5,6
i am addicted to selling on amazon and this app makes it so easy to stay on top of my business. awesome.,5,6
init,5,6
very good,5,6
easy to operate,5,6
excellent application for your business,5,6
app has evolved a lot. still features from website are missing.,4,6
love this app.,5,6
"the reason why amazon is market leader is because of their detailing be it the sellers app , payments , business reports . everything is crystal clear . it has help me grow my business .",5,6
freindly software,5,6
why sink money into scouting subscriptions when this works great for free?,5,6
this is a great app and amazon is a great place to buy and also a great place to sell !!! i've had an awesome experience thus far !!!,5,6
easy to use and easy to access,5,6
love it!,5,6
not sure what to do. i've uninstaller a couple times and it seems to continue to be buggy.,2,6
what's been shipped should be able to be seen and every separate product transaction should be viewable. every fee for every product shipped should be viewable,3,6
use it all the time makes searching for products quick and easy.,5,6
very very good side,5,6
makes my life so much easier,5,6
"i feel like i couldnt conduct business without it. i wish there were more things you could do like the full page site, but all in all its a great app. i use the scanner dailt, and keep track of everything i need to.",4,6
the older version clearly notified you if there was a question from customer and allowed to quickley respond,4,6
good app,5,6
this is a very basic app. more functionality would be nice. but it does work.,4,6
great app! i use it everyday!,5,6
seller central is now in my pocket. excellent interface,5,6
help to grow our business,5,6
"an up to date app which keeps on enhancing day by day, an no question asked it is the best aap compare to all other seller apps",5,6
"it's not bad,  i'm new to amazon and as a whole their setup is bulky and spread out. it's not as intuitive as other sites i sell on. ..but it's ok.",3,6
"latest update, as of today, will not install. even with cleared played store cache, restarting my device, restarting router, etc. i am running android 6.0.1. please fix this issue.",2,6
need more cowbell,4,6
a great app,5,6
"overall this is a great app. i like how simple it is, user interface is on point.",4,6
easy to use.,4,6
love it,5,6
user friendly!,5,6
"the app does as described and gives you access to your seller account. it loads quickly and everything from the website version is easily accessed. i do not, however, enjoy the interface... something just feels clumsy. doesn't feel like an official app, but it is indeed. rework the ui and you'll get 5 stars from me.",4,6
love it !!,5,6
very easy to conduct my business on this app. everything i need is here!!!!,5,6
best selling app.üòé,5,6
thanks,5,6
"with the new update, i can't see recent shipping sales.",3,6
on the go operation made easy,5,6
good,5,6
love this app,5,6
as you build your seller skills on amazon the app becomes more and more useful. there is always a learning curve but it helps me keep up with sales needing to be shipped asap and pricing update options.,5,6
great app,5,6
wish i could add handmade items through it though!,5,6
so helpful and easy to navigate.,5,6
seat at home do business,4,6
very useful app for seller,4,6
very easy to operate,5,6
"i gave this 4 stars because it's enough to get done but still lack some key features.  if you're on a business trip and wish to rely on the app, it's not possible.  you'll still need to log in from computer.",4,6
good,5,6
it's great,5,6
great applications,5,6
i love it,5,6
excellent,5,6
works well and provides basic sales and inventory info easily. i also love the chart view that compares sales with the previous week.,5,6
"i have been pleased with this app after some initials bugs got worked out.  i just wish it would give you all of the info you need, like campaign mgr and sales ranking.",4,6
really handy to check sales and remittance on the go. many other features. thank you !!,5,6
"in many ways, this is more useful than using the computer.",5,6
not digging this new recognition thing tho,5,6
nice app,5,6
used to be a great app but now it is constantly freezes and i cannot check my inventory of scan new products.  very frustrating.  3 stars because when it works i love it.,3,6
"when the app works, it's wonderful! it would get a 5 star rating without a doubt if it didn't lock up constantly. it's really frustrating when we're trying to figure out prices and have to keep fighting with the app.",2,6
i want the app to become independent of the website as i use it on my phone while traveling. mire features need to added which can be done on the website.,3,6
im a new seller and i use this app all the time and love it with all its features but am very glad a visual option was added as well as an fba label on the side of each fba seller similar to the regular amazon app!! this app is now at least 50% better now !!  the only thing i would like is to be able to access all the info of an item like on the main amazon app and maybe tie in with camelcamel that would make it just about perfect.  but i really do like this amazon seller app! :),4,6
"don't use indian flag as a doormat. and photos of indian gods on footwear, today i have uninstalled this app. shame on u. don't go to this much cheap level for marketing.",1,6
good app,5,6
great,5,6
"withhout this app, i would not be able to run my business from wherever i am. good job, amazon.",5,6
i liked previous layouts of this app tbh. but still very useful,4,6
it keeps me up to date and informed on all my inventory and sales. use it daily,5,6
wish it had the option of taking pictures of my item within the app.,3,6
needs some more tweaking,4,6
a good ready reckoner.,5,6

good service,5,6
nice app,5,6
"i kept wishing for a way for easy access to my seller account so was thrilled to find this app and am still figuring out what it can do. so many of the ways i would have liked to use it are restricted saying to use you must upgrade to professional & doesn't give instructions or easy way to do that. most of all, i wish i could delete the scanned items i don't want to enter. unlike the amazon shopping app where i can just hit delete, nothing i do seems to get rid of them. maybe if i upgrade? but how?",4,6
i love it,5,6
great tool. nothing negative to say.,5,6

"absolutely the best app i have. this makes listing, and managing my book business so much easier",5,6
i have to scan every item twice. after i scan it one time it goes back to scan again. waste of time.,1,6
i use it everyday.,5,6
very nice visual search tool added.,4,6
would definitely recommend this!,5,6
"i wish it did a few more things from the seller backend, but what it does, it does well.",4,6
ui can be more intuitive. but good in services.,4,6
love it. this is a great tool.,5,6
very helpful for quickly  checking of all requirments.,5,6

i would love to see year to date sales. but it's okay.,3,6
"love it for the most part,but it still has a few issues. i have scanned items in the store that showed a nice profit margin but when you get on the computer the profit margin is nowhere near what you thought it w√†s,so have come close to paying more than my return.2nd issue i have had is that it don't always show that an item is a slow mover or that amazon has an over abundance,you find that out when you get home with the item and are ready to post it. now with that said you still can't beat it as a beginner",5,6
indispensable,5,6

"great app, use it all day and rarely have issues",5,6
like it,5,6
this app is so necessary! it does everything it needs it to do but it continually freezes which takes more time. majority of the time i have to type in the item making it less efficient than it could be . i would give it 5 stars if it would not freeze up!!!! this app is an asset but its gotta stop freezing. sincerely an android user.,4,6
great for an overview of sales.,5,6

excellent app for any new seller or veteran amazon pro,5,6
i cannot think of any additional feature this should have.,5,6
excellent,5,6
i have used this on many occasions. sometimes it is my only link to seller central.,5,6
i scanned a  book by picture and it said it was selling for $25 used. scanned it again by upc code and it comes up selling for .25 used. so be careful with this app.,3,6

i love this seller app! it is so nice to be able to check in on our sales from absolutely anywhere!,5,5
"this app lacks many features. one need to open website on computer for many things, seller cannot rely completely on the app. for example i cannot upload a fresh product by a new brand or company, bounded to chose from the available products. that is ridiculous.",1,5

could do with more info in front of you on my phone rather than having to click on each item other than that pretty good,4,5
"i can't login, even after selecting forgot password and reseting my password i can't go through",1,5
easy to upload. don't like how difficult it is to add an item with no upc.,4,5
love it,5,5
nice app. gives enough for you to keep track of your business when far away from a pc...though still short of a replacement to a pc in many ways,5,5
"as a seller it is a helpful tool for quick and limited info, but  it offers only a fraction of what the full site offers. we use it for after hours simple communication with buyers.",4,5
easy to use app and a large part of my amazon business. by far my favorite for selling sites online.,5,5
it's much better than the previous versions,5,5
convenient and reliable! i also like the scan feature!,5,5
this app is great. it helps us to have the freedom to run our amazon business from anywhere.,5,5
"doesn't have all features of desktop, but enough to catch up sometimes",5,5
app feels pretty solid. thank you,5,5
always room for improvement,4,5
app works well and gives me a quick snapshot of my activity on a daily basis. just wish there was a little more drill down/historical capability.,4,5
almost useless now after update.,2,5
good app,5,5
i like it,5,5
"with this set up correctly, you can view your sales for the day in seconds and see up to minute orders. features being added gives confidence app will continue to improve. don't use for listing or scanning, but a free scanning app for beginners is unreal.",5,5
super lovely,5,5
helps a lot,4,5
p√≤oooor app doesnt open at all log out automatically,1,5
very useful tool for amazon sellers to have.  mixed reviews versus proponents of paid applications - but i think any amazon seller would be disadvantaged without it!,4,5
amazone,5,5
"amazon=service+brand+trustworthy+authenthicated product+seller as well as customer friendly, simply class!üëåüëç",5,5
app needs to support scanners,4,5
very good app.,5,5

quite good,5,5
its a great app for seller .. easy interface.. easy to update products anywhere ..,5,5
please integrate more of what you can see in the website and this will definitely be a 5.,4,5
this app is a great resource for anyone selling on amazon. the ability to scan barcodes and quickly list items from a scan is a game changer. the only reason i don't give this full 5 stars is that i haven't found a way to see/respond to feedback.,4,5
"would love it if we could setup replenishment from the app. as it stands,  it is smooth and very functional.   no real issues at all.",5,5
this app lets you do everything but print the label. it's so easy to use. it basically just has you fill in the blanks. the scan feature is perfect!  you can even look at the prices others are listing for so you can make an informed decision. it literally takes me 5 minutes to post an item.,5,5
good,5,5
good,5,5
nice app,5,5
great app,5,5
"its easy to use and very handy. just one problem...always to print the invoices seller needs to go to main website... this shud happen from the app itself. as now the pickup is scheduled from the app itself, so please add label and invoice printing from the app and no need to go to main website then",4,5
"easy to use, i feel better then previous version . real time notification no lag and thank you amazon for providing us this cool app.",5,5
easy to use. love that it calculates total sales for you in different formats. easy to update stock as well!!,4,5
"continuous login, logs out and requests another log in. totally useless.",1,5
pls add notification everytime a product is sold. also add feature where you can change the price when you need.,3,5
more services can be added to it..order reciept can be opened directly through app in place of going to site.,4,5
works!,5,5
great. but addictive.,5,5
saves valuable time. i can list while helping those less fortunate living among us. running a charity every second counts...,5,5
even though there is good internet . always show error asa. please check ur internet.,1,5
superb,5,5
i love it makes knowing how much you sold so much easier.‚ò∫,5,5

this amazon seller app has lots of bugs...the app freezes a lot everytime i use it and its pretty annoying...hope amazon finds a cure and fix this app coz i really hate it everytime it stops working and i have to restart my smartphone in order for the amazon seller app to start working again...pretty annoying üò†,1,5
meh,3,5
"great app,  does the essentials smoothly!",5,5
i can't believe my seller fees went to pay the idiot who came up with this horrible app,1,5
good way to track your fba sales.,4,5
essential tool for fba sellers.,5,5
"only flaw is detail settings are not there to change , like vacation, deleting listings, edit listings, and u  cant up load photos. other than that it helped me triple my sales!",4,5
great app,5,5
good,5,5
my business has been so much more successful since i started using this app.,5,5
easy to use,5,5
i love this app use it everyday it works great no problems with b****** although i really wish you could run an ad campaigns with it,4,5
"very friendly & best. price changing pattern should be more faster, its only the suggestion pl. wel its 4.5 stars",5,5
very easy to use and great for keeping track of your sales when you are on the move,5,5
only need to improve message and attach,4,5
on top of it!,5,5
good app,5,5
awesome,5,5
it makes working on the road a breeze. i use it only for responding to customer emails and have not tried the other features. i'm very pleased amazon has made this available.,5,5
"new to amazon, amazing app so far",5,5
awesome,5,5
it works well,4,5
"i like this app, it has almost all of the features i need from the main program.",4,5

great. easy to use,5,5
it's ok,4,5
it is my most used app. would be perfect if did that and included a profit calculator.,4,5
"you cannot rely on the app alone - ranks are widely different from what's on the website, having problems connecting to server if you start scanning more than just few products. good start, good ideas but more work needed.",3,5
you can check compare sales and other statistics.,5,5
i use it,4,5
i love amazon seller app. its very good.,5,5
it is really helpful to handle orders and can get much information to improve the sales.,5,5
very easily accessible. informative to the point.,5,5
getting better with successive updates.,4,5
fantastic app go for it!,5,5
limited use but for very infrequent sales it's fine.,4,5
"while i like that other apps show you the charts needed to make a wise decision, i really prefer the ease of this one and use it more than anything else.",5,5
good app for seller,5,5
"would like to see notifications for returns via push notifications even if i have to then click thru to the full site, they're important too yet amazon doesn't have it in the app. would be nice to have an option to silence sales sounds but have emails make a sound rather than pinging all day long with their awful little .ca-ching tone that could really use some help. lol. anyhow, overall its nice to update inventory on the go and keep track of what's selling to adjust other sales channels.",4,5
my bread and butter. :),5,5
awesome app keeps me up to date with messages.,5,5
super handy and works flawlessly. would love to see push notifications for fba sales too.,4,5
i only can scan about 4 or 5 things.. and then it'll freeze on a product page  that is blank.. and i'll have to restart 2 to 3 times before it takes.. and that drains my battery bad!!,1,5
wish campaigns were integrated i here to easily control them,4,5
imposes heavy commissions and unethically high shipping charges. worst marketplace. shame.,1,5
i think this is a great app but often when you open it the home page is not working properly which it's frustrating when you are trying to check your sales totals,4,5
thanks,5,5
love it!,5,5
great app. would be nice to see images of products on order history a+++,5,5
keep getting error code -505. factory reset and all.  i'm on a note 5 with marshmallow.,1,5

used to be the best seller app. now totally sucks! have to log in every single time. frustrating!,1,5
uov,5,5
"helpful to quickly check your sales, inventory and balance.",5,5
i use it everyday.,5,5
this amazon seller app is very helpful for the business. it makes monitoring of business stats and giving customer support much much easier.,5,5
favors fbm more than fba but is still good for seeing how many sales are coming in throughout the day. also a good barcode scanner for retail sourcing.,5,5
thank you amazon,5,5
this is amazing app to see list of pending orders n sales weekly comparision,5,5
"love it, but it would be so much better with  ppc (advertising) capabilities",4,5
easy to use and much quicker to see your sales and to list a sale than the computer,5,5
very useful,5,5
love the app to keep me in touch when i am away from my office.,5,5
"easy to use, jus like other stuff also would like to see pending order status. so that its convenient for us physically look for the stock.",5,5

takes some getting used to but not bad at all.,4,5
"notifies me when i sell a product, and is easy to view orders and confirm shipments. does its job and it easy to use.",5,5
i think this app is amazing for getting important info from my seller dash in a glance.,5,5

very cool app,5,5
but very bed,5,5
pretty great app. i love just quickly glancing at my sales data and it's great for responding to customers quickly.,5,5
i love this app. i have used it for the past year.  the release a few weeks ago keeps kicking me out and logging me all the way out.,3,5
love it,5,5
"for mobile app is great - simple, easy to use, reliable on the go.",5,5
works great. use it over other apps ive tried,5,5
"if something is refunded is shouldn't show in your sales graph or daily sales stats as that is confusing. would also be nice to have the ability to reprice in bulk, and have the option to show who is the cheapest next to a box where you can edit the price. apart from small things like that it's a great app and keeps me informed on the go.",4,5
"in the seller panel, payment panel showing different values in desktop version and mobile app. payment value shud be same in both desktop and app version",2,5
excellent app works as promised,5,5
great app . easy to use,5,5
really like it....only reason didn't give 5 star is because it occasionally signs me out and asks to sign again by selecting the country...,4,5
overall its a good experience. but if we can know which product is sold on particular day in an app it would be awesome.....,4,5
easy to use,5,5
i like a lot this app but i wish that i can get a notification each sale. so i can track them when doing other stuffs,4,5

this app allows me to keep track of my sales on the go. only thing i can complain about is the lack of a campaign manager for my sponsored products. it would be nice to be able to see how much i'm spending on my ads and even alter the daily budget etc..,5,5
and this app,5,5
"amazon used my barcode scan and put up a textbook that was incorrect. i shipped it across country selling it for a quarter of the price already and paying almost 20 for shipping. the seller complained. i reached out to amazon for some sort of resolution and receieved responses telling me to just refund. my book was never returned. it was one edition off. the seller probably still used it. i paid original price, shipping and then an extra $40 to refund this person who kept my property.",1,5
"i like using it to track my every day sales and respond to customer messages quickly.  the barcode scanner is a little weak and doesn't always work well, however.  overall, i like the app and use is multiple times daily.",4,5
it's clean design gives me the information i need when i need it.,5,5
great app i've had it for a while now. really do a great job keeping you in control of your amazon accounts (supports multiple countries),5,5

"no other marketplace is even close, app provides many site features in mobile form!",5,5
"really wish there was the ability to add a notification sound to notify when a sell is made, like ebay's cash register sound effect",4,5
"personally, this should be completely free with the bells & whistles. the more you sell the more money amazon makes. this app just makes it faster.",3,5
highly recommend for all amazon sellers. peace!!,5,5
"need to be able to see full sales info,  not just wtd and mtd. also, be good to see which item from inventory sold.",3,5
love it but one improvement needed. the sales figures need to reflect the refunds as well. other than that good.,4,5
great app,5,5
"perfect quick and easy. wish amazon would make it easier to pop the asin over to 3c or keepa, but it is what it is.",4,5
"this app is awesome for doing things on the go, but it can be slightly buggy at times.",5,5
its ok.as if there is much confusion using this app.please make it easy like snapdeal,3,5
feels good to use this app because lots of improvement done....,5,5
good for managing my seller while i'm remote.,5,5
"the scanner for the app should be able to scan the fba labels not just upc(s), also there should be a feature to add an item to a shipping plan. next i would like to see better business reports..i should be able to search and navigate through calendar days as if i were viewing from a desktop browser.",3,5
"since the new updates, this app keeps crashing and requesting market and login information each time. please fix it",3,5
"needs the ability to add pictures to used listings and add items to shipping plans immediately after adding them to your inventory. if you want to add a photo, you have to transfer the images to your computer and upload them through the inventory edit screen instead of adding them directly from the phone. the app will only allow you to go back to home after adding an item instead of giving you the option to add it to the shipping plan. i'm glad the app is improving and i would like to see these features.",4,5
love to hear the ring when a sale comes in! plus definitely helps me to be faster with resounding to customers!,5,5
i don't like the barcode scanner..,2,5

it's awesome,5,4
i would like to see a push notification for sales thru fba. also would like to see more report options. sometimes the scanner is difficult to use. it's great that it's free and shows the estimated fees.,4,4
"use this multiple times per day. one wish: show an unshipped order summary --&gt; 5 fields--&gt; sku#, trimmed prod.description,  # of orders (grouped by sku), total items ordered (grouped by sku), total $ (grouped by sku)... then $total unshipped",4,4
helpful,4,4
"great for tracking inventory, sales, pricing and reminding you when stock gets low",4,4
works great,5,4
"using a bt scanner in hid mode, you can enter a barcode in search however seller app does not look for a normal function to search like go or enter that can be added as a termination after the scan. i do like the new continuous scanning option.",3,4

"low commission rates, low shipping charges and amazing pickup facility. that's why i chose you.",5,4

really helpful for a new seller like me,5,4
makes business easier...,5,4
easy to use and keeps me informed on my business. also gives suggestions on what to sell.,4,4

amazon order id 404-4121990-5325925 ... you took my money and never deliver the product ... this is how you earn . cheaters ... where is my product . my money is hard earned .. your sellers saying it is delivered but i didn't get anything .... this is your business model by stealing people hard earned money ... god is watching your karma ... my money which u stole from me will lead to close down of your company .. this is how karma works,1,4

"i gave it a one star because you can't use your camera to find an item like you can with the regular amazon app. search for an item by taking a picture of it. selling new products is a bad feature because we dont have the option to sell what we have. we can only sell things in the catagories that amazon limits us to, for example, you can't sell a set of 1965 impala tail lights because under the autoparta catagories, it doesnt have a catagory for healights and also requires upc numbers. they dont have upcs.",1,4
you can't take photos within app. i can't see my competitions prices so i know where id like to price my items.  needs major updating.,2,4

it definitely performs some basic functions well but developers should focus on how app can be more efficient to accomodate the professional sellers or create another for professional sellers.,4,3
why would you have to pay to sell stuff. no good,1,3
its best n should add more features,5,3
i sell books on amazon and this app makes my work so much easier.  it not only scans but also provides useful info.,5,3

not able to custom search or create my own listing and pictures!,1,2

very hot,5,2
well to be honest i simply love this app as it helps to track my sales report on daily basis in single click.,5,2
i gotta say i'm quite impressed with this app... much better than previous version. leave it to amazon to do everything first class.,5,2
does not update sales properly. there are few options that actually work and are useful (giving accurate info). you will end up using the desktop version anyway.,1,2
very nice,5,2
"easy, fast, convenient.",5,2
"we just found out, that we are still able to login using app, after we changed the password on desktop. huge security flaw!",1,2

seems to always be a day behind,3,2
this app is very disappointing.  as a small seller i need to watch every penny.  there is no info about finances...what you've paid in fees what you've received...nothing.  every area ( which looks like it might cover this)  tells me i don't have permission to assess this area.  what do i need to do to grain access?,2,2

this is really fantastic.,5,1
oal is wel,5,1
"overall, this is a great app, but it needs work. for one thing, the pricing it displays is only the lowest price for each, which can be misleading, and doesn't allow you to do real competitive pricing.   this isn't huge, but the fact that the shopping app uses firefly scanning (so you can scan a book cover if it doesn't have a barcode) but the seller app only does barcode scanning.   my main qualm, though is that although the iphone version lets you add photos to your listings, the android version does not.",3,1

listing is super easy. it doesn't do everything that the web site does but makes things easier.,4,1

ridiculous,1,1
use it everyday and could not run or business without it.,5,1
"fantastic app, as i am not near a pc most of the time the use of this app is a tremendous help. from instant notification on a platform that is always near me to doing shipment on my device.  never had an app crash yet.  so far it's almost all i need. it will great if they could add order id to the shipping page of the item, as i only receive tracking number to the order id and not item description.  either way great app",4,1

kya bat h ap ke app or sisyam me payment panal itfa fake sa kse h shi kro use or plz reply this msg me,1,1
this app is incredible helpful. the only missing thing (which is very important to any seller that cares about quality listing) is the ability to take product photos. i do all my listings through this app and not being able to just snap and upload the product pictures at the same time is a big turnoff. please find a way to do it and you will get 5+++,4,1
the layout and simplicity of this app amazes me. it shocks me however that your website for sellers is complete garabge and an utter chaos,5,1
finally an easier way to sell on amazon.thank you amazon,5,1

"for the amazon seller application:  why can you not edit an item once you have added it to your inventory?  it would be nice if there was an option to add an actual item image as well!  also, you should add a ""report item"" link, so that when you are scanning a upc to upload a new item and encounter a incorrect product linked to that upc, you could report the issue. this is a major flaw!!  when searching an item, please add additional sort options, including ""order according to amazon sale ranking"" & ""price""",4,12

"we sellers want to hear a ""cha-ching"" notification when we make a sale! the etsy and ebay apps do it, and it's the most exciting and encouraging sound to hear as you go about your day. ‚ô° obviously, you'll also need the ability to turn the notification off incase it gets annoying.",4,12

amazon needs to work on the dashboard to make it similar to the main portal. it combines pending and confirmed orders which is totally confusing. it should show number of confirmed and pending orders in separate tabs as well as today's and this week orders in addition to total for next payment.,3,10

the new update makes it hard to navigate to the barcode scanner and the search results no longer display the ranking number which the most important part of being a seller on amazon. the weekly bar graph is no longer displayed on the home page.,1,10

works great. just think you should be able to do more without leaving the app.,5,7
nice useful app,5,7
fba fees are not correct.  unfortunately i did not realize this for over 4 months! i am very unhappy that az can't make an app that shows the correct fees.,2,7
seller app,5,7
verry verry good,5,7
helpful app...wish the seller central page had this type of interface,4,7
perfect. gets the job done.,5,7
this amazon crap charges to much.sell on mericari for free,1,7
good,5,7
what a terrible effort by amazon on this one. definitely one of my favorite companies but this app is a disgrace..,1,7
seller account not edited with app plz update,2,7
good app,4,7
works well with communicating with buyers.,5,7
"this app is a great companion to the reporting you get on sc. i would love if this could be extended to include vendor central and vendor central express. i have clients who don't want to shell out money for amazon retail analytics premium, but will use the basic reports just fine... if they had access to it from a mobile device",4,7
it logs out and takes me back to the page with the states already for 2 days,1,7
easy to use makes life a little easier.,5,7
very nice cool,4,7
eww,5,7
nice,5,7
why can't i take photos with this app?  book buyers want to see what they are getting and i'd like to see my photos when they buy it so i can find it in my inventory! which means i want to see the photos i uploaded on my inventory not yours.  scan bar code feature doesn't work. i spent 3 hours trying to find and/or add one book.  in the end i had to give up because it was too similar to another one so it wouldn't let me list it.  and your company wonders why people put books in wrong listings.,1,7
still lot to improve,3,7
great app. we done!,5,7
actually no 15 year old young man who can program an app a heck of a lot nicer than these apps or so subpar from almost laughable from this to the prime video its crazy that was fun to even try to download find in general too many apps our company that couldot even make the first one right,1,7
kiran,4,7
"could be better. no matter what user permissions you give another user of the seller central account. the app refuses to let said use view anything.  everything is ""you do not have permission to access this page"". then goes on to say the primary account manager can grant ""you"" the access.   ...i flagged this account as an f-ing admin on everything and yet ""you do not have permission to access this page"". the only way to get this to work is to sign in, on a mobile device (remember that), with the primary account. wooooow, that's such a smart idea.",2,7
nice,5,7
just an overview of everything,1,7
amazon seller app is perfect!,5,7
"not as good as amazon site, but still good",3,7
my app keep on trying to connect 3 times them drops me back to select your country screen and i have to reenter email and password. same thing happens again,1,7
must for amazon sellers.,5,7
confusing to use. not user friendly,1,7
garage can't even delete a listing from inventory,1,6
i didn't expect amazon to have such worthless app. they really need to work on this app before they bring it live for their users.,1,6
"been waiting a long time for this, worth the wait.",5,6
works well.,5,6
i used it and you should  try itüòä,5,6
i cannot manage my inventory. no options to change anything in inventory.,2,6
so nice apps,1,6
"helpful because the web based inventory page hangs up, but this has issues also...ie no way to change advertising settings :(",3,6
"always showing ""there was an error with your e-mail and password combination"" in second step;when it asks to re-enter password & given image for better protection. tried it 50 times, but unable to complete login.",1,6
it lags in terms of features compared to flipkart,3,6
"gotta hand it to the guys at amazon, this is a super app andi can say the support i have received using it is superb. reported a problem and within an hour it was fixed. made some suggestions yesterday, today they were available in the app. what more could you ask for?  jeff should be proud of the guys working on this project bravo",5,6
best. best,5,6
constantly logs out of my account,1,6
useful for sellers,5,6
we can just edit standard price. we can not edit sale price.,3,6
"any easier and its like selling at a ""upscale"" yard sale. control like no other, inventory adjustment done! communication's in a flash. sell.sell.sell ""in amazon we trust""",5,6
this is a great sales tool for amazon sellers. easy to use.  track your inventory and sales.,5,6
pretty good app that seems to have more up to date sales info than seller central. great for alerts when a customer emails and you can respond on the fly.,5,6
this is an excellent app that permits you to sell and track your sells. give it a try and see.,5,6
it didn't let me do any thing this app sucks,1,6
easy to use and practical.,5,6
working great now,5,6
practical,5,6
bust,5,6
very nice...,5,6
wish i can list like the amazon app but it is awesomeness,5,6
can't believe there's no way to upload images from a phone app!,3,6
perfect tool!,5,6
"perfect app, no need to logon to computer to manage orders, superb instant sell notifications",5,6
good but not fully.,2,6
"this app gave me option to manage my inventory and orders from anywhere. no need to carry a laptop and worry about what going on with your shop. one thing which is missing is low stock alert, rest is great.",5,6
"i'd like to have the option to leave feedback and read feedback left for me on mobile app. other than that, it's a good app.",4,6
"has unexpected features that were helpful, overall an essential tool for sourcing! it is free and helps track your seller performance",4,6
opv.,5,6
love it,4,6
"very dispointed in the lack of functionality. feel like i should be able to ship orders, authorize returns and respond to messages within this app, but unfortunately, i am only able to respond to message.",2,6
pls don't download,1,6
awesome now that the app works in the uk but the desktop design is easier to use even on my phone. unable to refine any item details apart from price.,2,6
nice but neefs work,4,6
blueboy industries,5,6
i like it so  much.but it's downloading capacity so bad,3,6
gives me what i need..would like a breakout of my fulfillment  vs fba,5,6
don't pay a monthly fee for what amazon provides for free. no it doesn't have the most advanced features but it has all the options and info that you need to make a decision when purchasing products.,5,6
nice hope i win contest,5,6
the information in any this is an automated message in and,5,6
it   is   new   for    me,4,6
easy to list and confirm shipments. not able to create a sale price and a few other features the website has.,3,6
this app has allowed me to research and easily list items,5,6
bad service,5,6
good if you may add payment panel.,3,6
"it's useful but only to an extent. needs more features to allow you to have more ability to manage your selling. plus, would be nice to be able to view your seller information...",3,6
cnt signinƒ£ in.. what hpnd mon diu,2,6
great for tracking sales.,5,6
keeps me in touch with all my customers we're ever i am.,5,6
nice amezon,5,6
"its okay its good to inform for report see ur products and who buy and shipping etc on mobile while away from pc... problem is u cant do edit full on ur products like pictures, info stuff. i will give it 5 stars if its can full access like from pc site.",3,6
unreliable,2,6
it is a very useful and nice app. loved it,5,6
"ability to add photos?  nope.  option to add or edit a description.  nope.  can we see a product's going price?  nope.  how about our seller feedback, can we at least view that?  nope.  well, tell me what can we do in this app?  you can change an item's price...smh.  the app is useless folks.",1,6
has all the necessary figures to make an informedo decision on if you should purchase items for sale! highly recommend,5,6
"i would prefer to have my entire listing available so i can edit more efficiently rather than waiting until i get home from work to use my laptop. i also have to use my laptop rather than the app to tranfer funds and see what my ratings are. it would be helpful to have the ability to add a photo to the listing. having more detailed product information when researching than what is available is crucial for everyone concerned. the more efficient the app- the better. happy sellers, makes happy customers.",3,6
i would give this app 4 stars but i can't because i can't post pictures from my phone directly to my listing which makes no sense,1,6
ok,5,6
this app has so much potential but in practice it is a steaming hot turd. it simply does not work correctly.,2,6
love this app. it is great for scanning items and checking your account on how much sales you have made.,5,6
"thank you amazon for finally separating the seller app into its own account settings!  now i can use my amazon music, shopping, and fresh apps without having to log out of my selling account.  steps in the right direction!",4,6
it is a very exciting app when you start selling on amazon.,5,6
"this thing deserved 10* until recently. now, after two updates, it crashes constantly. i can scan for 5 to 10 minutes and it locks up.",3,6
at last amazon seller app for uk and europe amazing amazon thanks,5,6
very nice application,5,6
"very poor still!!. cant add my price, and still the bar code is useless",1,6
"first of all this app has the ability to be great. would like first screen to go straight to orders so i can process and print. after all, the notification is telling me that something sold so let me go to that immediately. to see sales comparison screen first thing is useless. would like orders filter to default to whatever you last chose or be able to save to default settings. it is a waste of time to change this past 3 days every time. at least make it ""7 days"" and ""all orders"" to match website.",2,6
with a few glitches,4,6
see the info quickly and easily with easy to use screens.,5,6
there isn't many options on the app and amazon is not very seller friendly!,1,6
"tried to scan bar code phone will vibrate as if it has scanned the barcode, nothing then it vibrates again then finally acts as if it is scanning goes blank, then goes to the amazon seller home screen. this app would make my life a whole lot easier if it worked!",1,6
super,4,6
amazon will shut u out of ur account and hold ur money for 90 days.,1,6
"update has broken the app. unable to login as keyboard will not enable. this is serious as it will affect my amazon metrics if i am unable to answer messages on the fly! as per the developer below i was able to log in after deleting ""lux"". now it is duplicating all notifications.",1,6
not able to sign in at all...,1,6
so much,5,5
nice app,3,5
this application is very complicated compare to the ebay selling app it's very difficult to sell an item on amazon i cannot find my item when i scanned the barcode  i can't add a new item in it,1,5
have a good shhoppng exprence,4,5
app broken,1,5
i have already sold 50+ products in amazon..this app shows u r not the amazon seller..i hate this app..,1,5
i do like this app it is convenient i would love to see that the tabs on the home page could be customized to buyers preferance please consider this amazon! thank you it really is a helpful app!,3,5
great app a lot of new stuff,5,5
"the new update is completely non functional.  freezes on the login screen every time.  uninstall/reinstall doesn't work,  restart doesn't work.  please fix it quick.",1,5
no keyboard on login screen. fix this asap,1,5
"it says ""you do not have a registered, active selling on amazon account in this marketplace."" i have sold over 50 items using amazon seller on my desktop pc. this new amazon seller mobile app is no good, completely useless without being able to login.",1,5
if you can edit descriptions/photos of your listing through this app i've yet to find it.,2,5
it's nice to sell the product here üòÜüòÜüòÜ!!!,5,5
cant find the uload button,1,5
love the convenience of this app. makes managing on the go a breeze. my only wish is that you could update inventory and edit your listing with it too...then it would be 5 stars.,4,5
works good,5,5
nice app,5,5
good details for quick action appreciate,4,5
i just use this app to check on sales for the day and i like it!,5,5
nice app.to purchase,3,5
"this app is incredibly useful if you are an amazon seller. it definitely beats using your mobile browser to view amazon seller central. the only thing i don't like is that it only shows your product sales and not your total balance including shipping credits and such. aside from that and not being able to correspond with customers from the app, its pretty well put together and very easy to navigate. much easier to use if i need to double check an order or something rather than getting on the computer.",4,5
"not the actual amazon seller account, only for companies",1,5
....as much use as in the uk!,1,5
awsome and best onlin shopping site,5,5

i am not able to see lowest price on a particular item which i used to see earlier. lots of bugss !!!,2,5
loved it,5,5

very helpful for the purpose its made. give all the information which requires fir seller,4,5
i like,5,5
"why is there no option to sell in the uk, or anywhere within europe for that matter? amazon is cutting off a huge part of its market by not giving the eu access, please update and include a wider variety of counties to access",1,5
frustrating that its not available for uk sellers. fix this!,1,5

one improvement i would like to see is when you scan an item and look it up please get all the different prices people have offered for you had the option to just choose prime members offerings instead of having all the one cent $3.99 offers be able to just select prime offers.  instead of just saying total sales if i could also select gross profit after all the amazon fees.,4,5
i love it,5,5

"my seller's account works fine on their website. this app, however, is way too complicated and riddled with bugs. every time i click on something it loads for like 30 seconds then tells me something went wrong. all i want is to confirm a shipment and it just took me 15 minutes of searching around with no results. just use the website.",1,5

superbb deals,5,4
super,5,4
missing key features that are available on the page.,2,4
amazing seller panel its great,5,4
amazon seller is best seller in  world,5,4
why do u call this seller app when there is no option to manage the inventory or make the products go active or inactive and atleast update the price of the products ? the only thig it does is it shows when and how much we sold in a week.,1,4
good for this,5,4
"this is a good and necessary app,but scoutify has a better scanning tool",5,4
this is useless the amount of info is no use to me. it is only good for personal seller. i manage the account for multi million dollar seller but the tool and information that is in the app is very limited. going back to browser.,2,4
"does not give option to post product, product info, or photos. only lets you see current sales and progress. uninstalling!",1,4
horrible app!!!! no edit functions whatsoever,1,4
cannot log into us. no keyboard comes up to enter email address for log in. can't retrieve password or sign in. nothing happens. disappointing.,1,4
awesome app,5,4
delivering smile,4,4
r g,5,4
"the doesn't do enough to let you know the status of what you're selling. has the customer received the item? when will i be paid? these questions go answered. the biggest problem though is the nearly 3 week wait to be paid for my product. i shipped off my 3ds on 4/13, and i'm told i won't be paid until may 2 !?! are you kidding me?! i will not be selling anything else on amazon until a more realistic time frame is used for dispersing payments.",1,4
this app would be so much better if it supported  a  bluetooth barcode scanner and if it was possible to prepare shipments.,4,4
excellent,5,4
useless,1,4
i got really excited when i saw this app. been looking for one for a while. after i installed it realised it is only for 3 countries. come on amazon you are the biggest marketplace on the web develop an app for all counties inc the uk.,1,4
love it,5,4
"only india, japan  and usa",1,4
good,4,4
it keeps trying to connect and disconnect again nd again,1,4
bacause it allows all the enquires,5,4
needs too many changes and improvements,2,4
great,1,4
"the penis logo needs to go amazon, grow up",1,4
wow man!!,5,4
user friendly,5,4
i loved it...as it's just a initial launch...the app notifies all about new orders and messages from customers... if you guys can add scheduling options and shipping confirmation within the app...that would have been awesome...,5,4
love it but wish you could create orders from phone.,5,4
good one,5,4
a different on,3,4
i dont know if yall did something but every time i turn on the scaner it crash or just leave the screen black. why why why ? ???,3,4
nice,5,4
"it's time to put a full development team behind this. this is far far far behind real time stats. implementing the ability to save your settings so filters don't need reset every time the app is opened should have happened a long time ago, like in alpha stage. that said, the scanning option is fantastic! having the ability to save scans and revisit later is an enormous time saver.",3,4
...,5,4
"data provided, although limited, was also inaccurate. i wanted to check the tracking number of an item i shipped, but none of my orders were in my orders section. so while i would like to be able to maintain my seller account while mobile, i' not sure this app will suffice.",1,4
"this gives you  a better balance of a stucture of ""how to"" concerning  your  own  kinda  weird  sells  of your  business",3,4
so nice,4,4

it's good app,5,4
"so much simpler than using the desktop version, not to mention the scan feature that allows me to scan items on the go.",5,4
you can not see enough of your seller central information with this app for it to be of much use.,2,4

hard to use and doesnt function properly. bugs,1,3
this is a great app to sell items on amazon but it has some glitches.  i have been listing and every other listings dissapear once you hit complete and never list and you have to redo the listing.,3,3
"as a used book seller, i primarily use the app to research prices when perusing thrift stores and estate sales.  i have wasted time and money with the app, purchasing books that appeared to have a profitable selling price, only to discover the pricing to be inaccurate at best when i listed at home (i.e. selling price one cent).  the app needs to be customizable, so i can view only used prices, without shipping costs, without automatically returning to default settings.",1,3
good...,5,3
it would be awesome if you could include a way for me to see my current balance on the app.   i hate having to log into the full site just to see my incoming payment at any given time. on mobile it takes a long time and having it in the app would make me a happy user.   thanks again keep up the awesome work i love your programming.,5,3
i love amazon,3,3
it's refreshes and restarts it won't let log on to account,3,3

amazing app for sellers from amazon. sellers can now view their stats and do more on the go.,5,3
"useless. done by people who has no clue what is the difference between seller and buyer. bunch of statistics and few tools which can be set from buyers prospective, but are useless in this form for sellers. this team should be fired.",2,3

after the update nothing but freezing. why update if the app doesn't work anymore?,1,2
oneplus one user. can't scroll though my inventory without it clicking a product. can't edit anything in my listings other than price. few more things i can't think of now. i'll rate this a 5* when i see just the two things i listed fixed.,3,2
before the latest update app was 5 stars used it every day all day was great app.  now all it does is freeze and force close.  can scan maybe 3 items then it force closes and i have to restart app. lg e980,3,2
this app is incredibly helpful for sellers. the cost calculator is excellent. still waiting for shipment creation then this will be a 5 star app.,4,2
every time i try to scan the app just keeps crashing.,1,2
"i expected more from amazon, they're obviously not serious about the needs of a seller. not much in terms of features and functionality. third rate production.",2,2
"superb,  excellent,  loving it",5,2
"app needs work.  can't do much with it other then get a status on open orders, and activity.",3,2
"in the app.  the settings are very bare and minimal and i still do not know how to change my email address linked originally to my account.  i wanted to change it to a new email so as to not mix my sells with my junk mail.  been trying for 2 weeks and still can find how.  however, to add inventory and access buyers information is very simple.",3,2
very good,5,2
love this app. so easy to use,5,2
seller,5,2
the absence of a payment confirmation menu or a payment schedule sidemenu really cuts into the operation. i always have to navigate out of the app to the website page to see my next scheduled pay period.,2,2
it just kinda focus' around how much you sell.,3,2
"app lets me know when an order has been placed, and it lets me add inventory on the go, very helpful! would be a little better if i could see my account health, customer reviews, customer messages, and pending orders on it also, but overall it really does come in handy, not going to complain :)",5,2
no major complaints. looks like it is well polished.,4,2
my husband and i used to be able to list books with this app but it seems that is impossible with a new update,2,2
cant wait for create shipment,4,2
"barcode scanner doesnt work, old books can't list due to no barcode, can't delete listings, and can't change account information such as phone number or bank account info. sales are down and i am lossing personal money. i recommend for temp use if person has no computer like me.",3,2
the app is still connecting even after i changed my password. how do i revoke permissions from the app on my lost phone?,1,2
fairly easy to use. i'm not a putter nerd but easy for me. very useful. tc.,4,2
love it,5,2
hate amazon,2,2
"wish i could get a ring for notifications, like ebay.",5,2
i love this app because i can check my items for sale right in hand when i leave the office. a little confusing but today is my first day using it. its missing something but i'll figure it out later.,5,2
"settings don't save. main screens have nothing to do with orders, just listing/selling.",1,2
easy and fast !!!,5,2
can't even use it for trade-in account.,1,2
have been waiting so long for amazon to release this.  this will make growing our small business so much easier,5,2
just perfect for me!,5,2
needs a lot more features.,3,2
unless i go on my computer and log in i can't tell what is going on with my amazon fulfilled items.,1,2
this app is very helpful in keep up with my amazon business.  i would like to be able to upload photos with new listings i create here. then i could give it 5 stars.,4,1
good,4,1
didn't work,1,1
the app works very well at notifying me of new orders and providing basic inventory management. i use website for heavier inventory duties. the cherry on top of this app is the barcode scanner - it's better than any stand-alone scanner app i've ever used!,5,1
love it.,5,1
point at bar cite and zap. almost all info automatically entered. just set price and quantity and your done.,5,1
listing items using the scanning option is extremely easy. i prefer it to the web option,5,1
"crashes constantly!  can only scan about three or four books before i have to restart. worse: info is inadequate. why include shipping,  but then take shipping out when you look at the cost? just tell me what it freaking sells for with shipping... just like it does on amazon.",2,1
this is so easy to use!  love it!  listed my first items today and one sold within an hour!,5,1
just downloaded and went through the features and what not.  great tool/app for on the go and quick reference!,4,1
"this is not the most feature rich app, but the book scanner is an amazing time saver. for me, the app is worth it just for that.",4,1
"i'm still getting familiar with this app, it is a nice option to have when selling on amazon, but like anything there's always room for improvement",4,1
features are increasingly useful. i like the dashboard and the ability to check unshipped orders on the go.,5,1
i must say this app is improving after each update. thank you,3,1
no inventory restocking allowed. no sale processing allowed. no pending transaction view. just to see sold items and get happy about it!,2,1
works great! saves me a lot of time. i use this on my phone and tablet. thanks amazon!,5,1
"there's really no point of doing the whole monthly payment thing, especially after this new update it doesn't even know whose registered i'm glad i didn't pay",1,1
i liked it before the update. i couldn't get the app to  update.  it only went 56%. i uninstalled the app and now can't get it back.  only installs 96%. i now have no app,2,1
"i signed in and it says can not  connect to amazon webpage , whats going on? need help",1,1
it was perfect up until the update it did today... now it's telling me i'm not a registered seller in the us marketplace.  it wouldn't even let me contact amazon. wtf.,1,1
sometime the screen overlaps and you can't read anything.,3,1
i like it except i downloaded it because my boss has a business on amazon but because i was signed in with his stuff it screwed with my otheramazon apps like when i want to shop or listen to my music. so i had to uninstall it and may possiblybe looking for a new job,4,1
this is a great app and long awaited!,5,1
"at this time this app is limited to registered, active selling on amazon customers in the us marketplace.",1,1
simple and useful. haven't had enough time to provide a complete review for each feature.,4,1
the needs lots of work!,3,1
"this thing is sort of near-perfect, just missing some things, and not that intuitive.",4,1
works great,5,1
"love that i can check prices and list on the go. it has made my life so much easier by just being able to scan barcodes on all kinds of items, not just books. however the app will only give you minimal info on your actual account. i wish it had full features so we could see account balances and view when deposits will be made.",4,1
"update: 1-12-15: downgrading to 1 star because these basic fixes have not been done after months, and after numerous reviews requesting them. this could be the best app on the market with these minor tweaks.   on the initial product search screen, the offers still need to be able to display sorted by fba by default, just as on the normal amazon desktop website. currently the offers cannot be sorted by fba at all, just by ""any"", and that only on the click through page.   support for a bluetooth laser scanner is a must and needs to be added soon.   these will be 5 star changes to this app, which i check on a daily basis. amazon sellers pay $40 a month for products like this, and i hope support can get some of these needed changes done soon.",1,1
it's an excellent app to have if you want to list your items for sale quickly.,5,1
no tablet support,3,1
"great app just needs more features like payments and a better sales tracker(expenses,cost vs total sold). but besides theese future improvements app is awesome.",4,1
please make this fully functional and i will up the stars,2,1
i can't figure out how to use it . i only see search and when i put in what i wanna sell it just says not found,1,1
"the app worked fine for a few months and then i began getting emails that my shipments were late even though i had confirmed them with the app. i missed one of these emails and was told my buyer had been informed it was a late shipment. opening the app all of the orders are ""fullfilled"" but not in seller central online. my phone had a factory reset recently and the problem happened before and after that. it's a nifty app when it works, but the point of an app is to avoid logging in on a computer.",2,1
"displayed an incorrect account balance, can't edit listings once they've been created, can't view notification messages. i'm not even sure this app has a point....",2,12
have sold on amazon for a while. use ebay more often and gave up on amazon ever getting an ap. after getting new phone contract i checked again and much to my surprise they offer a selling ap. will update my review once i have enough experience with it to have an honest review.,3,12
good i,5,12
would be better if you could also login into amazon international accts. having a mult. login app would allow me to view my other marketplaces.,3,12
"very good app. easy to use and love the notifications. i think it has made me quicker to ship items out because i am not checking my emails for orders, i see the notification and i go pack the order right then. the reporting is cool, too.",5,12
"when i first installed about two wks ago, it worked great. now it won't open at all, just keeps spinning.. please fix as my mom uses this app for her store..",3,12
the app is telling me i'm out of the usa but i'm not? how is that?,2,12
"i wanted something simple while on the go to keep in touch with my sales. i dl this app, but it says need an account in the us market place to use. i have a valid web store (not seller account like ebay, the $80 a month store). is this app not compatible with that. am i limited to login into seller central only?",2,12
needs to add the capability of uploading product pictures.,4,12
won't let me log in.,1,12
i am hoping they bring more seller options so i don't have to login on the browser anymore. but for a quick look at some things it is good. if support is reading this.... do you plan on creating a widget for our homepages?,4,12
was waiting for this to finally get updated. it works very well for what i need.,4,12
nice put together,5,11
wow,5,11
i keep on getting a message saying it could not connect to the server.,1,11
"after several problems with ebay, i'm moving my store to amazon. not my first sale on the site but using the app will be. i just hope it has good functionality to post items with ease and camera settings & tools to adjust images for the listings. will re-rate after a couple uses this weekend. have some new stuff to sell. can't wait to try it out.",3,11
problems opening app and limited what is found,2,11
keeps getting better. keep up the good work.,4,11
great,5,11
"this app is incredibly useful, and rivals the apps that require monthly subscriptions.  there's just one crucial feature missing in the barcode scanner/search results: a tab for fba offers. i hate scrolling through all the offers to find the fba offers! also very useful would be a link to the camelcamelcamel chart for a given product. this is a major selling point for competing apps.  add it and you've got them, amazon! without these two features, i'm still looking at other apps and considering whether they are worth the money.  add these two features, and i'll never stray from you. <3",4,11
always managing my inventory and orders on the go now which is perfect. would like to do many more things on mobile straight from the app because it always redirects me to and internet service but overal great work!,5,11
if it runs on my device ok ! i guess,3,11
"if you can use it based on not changing any default settings then it's ok. but don't try searching for an inventory item or using the sort filters, you will be waiting all day. also i can only see the first 25 items in my inventory",3,11
"the app has improved since the (approx.) oct. 31st/nov. 1st update. but for the app to be truly useful there must be more order management, and added shipping options. it would be great if the seller app was able to handle the full gamut of the seller's function/tasks, from listing an item, to managing inventory, through to selling and shipment. ebay's app is pretty good, and might be looked at as a reference. one can manage a number of the seller task functions there( i.e. ebay app).",3,11
"i need to be able to confirm shipments and see all of my inventory, not just what hasn't sold.     edit: now you can confirm shipments :)",5,11
finally able to manage my orders and confirm shipments,5,11
would like to see offline database for scanning.,4,11
"this used to be just a listing of your inventory. now that you can actually see when your items get sold, it has so much more functionality. one problem... logging in and out is a pain.",4,11
would like to see what was just order. it only shows what was shipped.,3,11
"it's still slow, buggy and clunky, but the idea is here and it just needs tons of fine-tuning.",3,11
"everything was working pretty good.  would scan barcodes rather quickly, however now it takes forevvvveeerrrrr to scan one.  it doesn't want to focus.  this should/needs to be corrected asap.",3,11
much better to just go to seller central in my mobile browser and manage inventory and buyer communications.,2,11
"the app looks nice but it never loads my orders page which is really the only reason i want to use it. i wish i could more easily turn off notifications, as i don't deal with messages",2,11
needs a wee bit more functionality. i want to run my business from this. i can't ship from this yet ?!?!?! someday shortly i hope :),4,11
since the update the app will not focus on the barcode making it almost impossible to scan anything. this is on my galaxy 5. other apps focus fine.before the update it worked well now it is almost useless,1,11
amazon,4,11
why is it i can do everything but scan a package i've shipped to provide a tracking number to a customer? 5 stars when this is built in!,3,10
we currently use the sellers app to run our fba business. we been on here since it first launched and it is the best app for sellers i have ever used. the new update is awesome. it does take some time to learn the ins and outs but overall it is a five star app for sellers. thanks amazon,5,10
helps with my obsessed.   lol,5,10
needs improvement..1 i can't view items that have been purchased. 2 no way to confirm shipping 3 lacks beneficial features. easy 5 star with these improvements. thank you.,2,10
"great app, but now i can't get past login screen.",1,10
can't sign in,1,10
barcode scanner hasn't worked for a month.  please fix...,1,10
"this app seems to have one function only: listing inventory. that's handy, but seriously - that's it?? there is so much more to selling on amazon than this. primarily, i need to see and deal with orders. what a waste of my time and the space on my phone. huge disappointment. uninstalled.",1,10
good money,5,10
excellent tool! thank you.,5,10
i've tried uninstall/reinstall but i can't get past the spinning yellow loading icon.,1,10
app was very dependable until this most recent update. now crashes constantly,5,10
add ability to delete inventory,4,10
"tried to sign in and the captcha simply did not work no matter how many times i tried it. and worse, you had to re-enter information every single time!!! dumb",1,10
fix bugs and ill try it again,1,10
"i like this app a lot. anxiously waiting for the features listed as ""coming soon"".  order management, notifications, etc.",4,10
it's okay. very limited abilities. tried for a few weeks.  i uninstalled the app until the better one comes out.,3,10
this app occasionally hangs up usually when you are busy scanning. annoying! it should support a bluetooth upc scanner. needs more seller central controls. other than that it's a great start of a very useful app!,4,10
"the app is nice . i found it impossible to scan isbn. it surely needs improvements, it is a great app nontheless",3,10
thanks amazon ...,4,9
i only got to use this app twice and after that its been stuck on the loading screen and hasn't been working ever since. i'm going to try to uninstall and reinstall again,2,9
doesn't have an option to review recently sold items? cool,1,9
"in comparison to their mobile site, this app rocks. very simple to use, and makes selling a breeze!",4,9
good but i can't upload products using the scan feature on the app.,3,9
"offers some good features. however, it crashes often and loads slow. samsjng s3",2,9
i am very happy with this app. i can have my selling done fast and easy just scan the barcode or search for the same item and post,5,9
useless no link to whatever a us marketplace account is why have the app if you cant use it,1,9
i have wished for this. its a dream come true!,5,9
thanks,5,9
tried to use this app was not able to even get it to work. removed in 10 min.  don't bother.,1,9
i'm sure happy about my collectibles i can sell on amazon!,4,9
only use for this app is to send messages. only thing i found useful. the ebay app is way better. this one just keeps directing me to the mobile site when i need to do something.,1,9
"got to see the app once, since then i can't get past the loading screen after log in. amazon nor the developer have been able to resolve.",1,9
kinda buggy on my note 8.0 doesnt register ehen i put a quantity,2,9
"app is nice and all, but lacks the natural feeling of basically any other app. it chugs along at a very slow pace.",4,9
shipment confirmation bottom and maybe code scaner for shipment,4,9
needs a little work but the best one out there right now,4,9
"like many of u here complaining, i was very disappointed that i couldn't check my orders on this app, which is the whole reason i looked for, and downloaded this app. but i did find another app on the play store that does just that. the name of the app is, mws sales. you have to register and activate it from amazon to work. but they walk you through it nicely. in no time i had my whole inventory, and yes orders, available to check. i'm in no way affiliated, or work for that app. just figured it will help",2,9
uninstalled profit bandit because this covers all major features. great work. keep it up.,4,9
"i was hoping this app would work something like the desktop version. . not even close! the main reason you want an app is so you can see your orders, what products sold and customer info - this app does none of that. a complete waste of time, don't bother downloading it, it's not worth you're phone space. i'm uninstalling it myself.",1,9
dosent work,1,9
very good app!,4,9
great start but it has room to grow. nice to have order notifications. adding purchase cost is clumsy.,5,9
want something that will notify you when your inventory has been paid for? want to mark an item as shipped or manage your orders in any useful way? then download the ebay app and use their service instead. amazon's become reliant on their own warehouses over small sellers and we're not worth bothering with apparently.,1,9
"this app does need some more improvement. it's has so much potential it could be the best thing going. it is a little slow at times however it does what it claims to do. i would love to see frequently bought together items somewhere in the app.  hot sellers,  and value of the day. i am still going to give this app a 5 stars...because i know what it can be. i am sure they (developer) will update and because what benefits the seller will benefit them in their return on investment.",5,9
i wish the app could reside as a widget on my home screen so i can see the graph showing sales details and message alerts at a glance. flaws found in fulfillment by seller formula.  as for the listing functions i have just one concern.  i don't like that amazon competes with sellers and dominates the buy box. providing them our  purchase prices so they can take away more sales is concerning. for that reason i use with caution. otherwise i give amazon a big thumbs up for providing this to sellers.,5,8
deals,5,8
i sell on amazon this is great,4,8
this app has made things so much easier to list on amazon. ebay needs to step up their game!,5,8
its a good app,5,8
refreshing is working better since the update.  i really like the interface and am looking forward to getting more information through the app.  this is where that commission is worth it!!,5,8
you can't do anything on it,2,8
"app doesn't show orders. i got it hoping to view orders and get the buyers mailing info. these two features are what i need, otherwise useless. why have the app if it can't cover the basics. also, not sure i can add to my inventory. again another basic not included.",1,8
nice!,5,8
"this app is super helpful for me as a seller. it helps me get an exact picture of what items are selling for on the actual amazon site so that i can make faster, better decisions on what to sell. this app will surely help me sell a lot more!",5,8
this app is good but requires more features on it i have to go to the main site in order to be able to see everything i thought y the app would be the same but it's not,3,8
makes selling easy,5,8
they have a lot of work to do on this app. crashes everytime i try to check messages.  this makes the only useful thing being able to list items by scanning a barcode which is something i never do.  this app sole purpose is  getting amazon more money not helping sellers be more efficient.,1,8
it's very sensitive also when i go back it doesn't load unless i restart the app,3,8
it is hard to believe that amazon would publish an app for vendors and resellers with so few features available to android clients.,1,8
collectibles,3,8
"the app itself isn't terrible, but i have a separate amazon account that i sell from. signing into this app with my seller account signs me into the other amazon apps with my seller account, which isn't a prime account or linked to my personal data. isolate this account from the other accounts on the phone and i'll give it another shot, but until then the inconvenience of having to log out and then back in to the other amazon apps far outweighs any of the small benefits of this app.",1,8
"works great up to this point, once they incorporate the order management tools it will be perfect!",5,8
selling tools,5,8
"release early. iterate often. needs work, but glad it's finally here.",2,8
must have if your a seller!,5,8
i'm just glad they have this now. there's no need to nit pic. updates will fix it. thank you.,5,8
i get notifications. i open them and it force close. every time.,3,8
nice app. hopefully the restrictions section will be updated to include hazmat and other restrictions,5,8
4 stars for releasing this app. 5 stars when a bluetooth scanner option is added!,4,8
about time!!! waiting for manage order tab to come out and unresponsive most of the time,3,8
needs improvements. it is new so i wasn't expecting much. but ok for now.,3,8
love this app! very convenient. a lot of coming soon.,5,8
i was using it on  ipad love the way you can see your sales without going to amazon website,5,8
very convenient,5,8
i love it!! its easier to get our products selling faster. working together to making it better in amazon. don't stop keep going forward and beyond,5,8
awesome,5,8
i have been waiting for this to come out for a few months.  it seems to work well.  it's nice to have a free alternative to profit bandit whom decided to start scalping their customers.,5,8
"this app is not at all a full blown seller central, but it can do some tasks easier than the website, such as change product prices to compete with other sellers, respond to messages, and that's it. the builtin pictures for the inventory makes it very easy to find your item. on the bad side, you can't view your orders. not even new ones / number unshipped. the bar graphs suck. please use the actual balance/deposit data and also all the seller rating data. that would complete this app. &lt;&lt;&lt; thanks devs ^^^",3,8
thanks you,5,8
love being able to check sales volumes throughout the day.   looking forward to more updates.,5,8
what an app,5,8
i shared with my youtube subscribers. this will help those starting fba or those that can't afford another subscription based app.,5,8
it is a start. it would be nice if you could communicate with the buyer in the app without having to open a webpage. it would also be nice to see orders etc in the application.  for now i have to give it a low score. it has way too many things missing. with as big as amazon is it shouldn't be that hard to get your development team to make it more user friendly. you take enough in fees just from us to pay for a team to do that in short order.,2,8
i love this app about time it came out for android. imagine al the profits it will bring!,5,8
