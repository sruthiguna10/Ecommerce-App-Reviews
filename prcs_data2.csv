"worst seller support, compare to all other eccomerce platform, the seller support give the threat to us that she block the account, disconnect the call within 3-4 min, it's seems like horrible place we are working, nvr seen this type of disgusting support from the flipkart nowdays they only give priority to the cx only we doesn't matter for the flipkart, we are the main source of earning of your platfrom and you even didn't care for our issue so it doesn't make any sense on using this platform",1,6
"worst app ever,even i don't want to give a single star to the app, it's been 3months from then i am trying to list my product but i'm not able to list even a single product,and not able to contact customer support. i'm a seller on amazon the amazon seller app is just fantastic,so easy and so simple to list to contact customer support",1,6

selling experience is just pathetic. amazon is way better than flipkart. returns are not completed even after arriving at local hub and also no return policy for innerwears. flipkart just sell their own in-house products by looting new small sellers. dont sell and buy anything from flipkart and instead make your own website and sell by promoting it on your own terms.,1,6

flipkart is just wasting there time . if new sellers are willing to start selling on flipkart please dont . you will get nothing but loss . they already have shortlisted good products for there own sellers like retailnet etc rest is for you and me . you will die handling return. in starting you will get claims for your lost products but sooner they will stop that and that time may god bless you. stay away from flipkart . dont buy dont sell anything until they dont have proper policies.,1,2

customer cancelling orders without any reason. sometimes delivery agent do not deliver product. sometimes there is pin mismatch. sometimes delayed orders leads to order cancellation. returned products are damaged. margin is very less for seller. if order is cancelled then packaging cost &time is wasted. there is no shield for seller against any of the above .,1,1

flipkart is very good platform for business but it's return policy is not good. return policy should be different on different categories. like jewellery items should have return policy of 24 hours only because most of the customers just order these precious items and then after using it on marriage and other occasions they just returned it after 1 week with nonsense reasons. in this no one bears the loss not even flipkart. the loss bears by the sellers only.,1,10

i personally noticed that.. flipkart hiddenly deducte little little ammount from your total postpaid or prepaid balance...i noticed many time but this time i see that without showing any return during 3 days my postpaid balance 18000 something to 17400.. i ask about their support team but they don't answer it.. and ask me to check all the order ids sold.. its too time taking they know that.. thats why they said that type off thing... as a seller i am disappointed with flipkart,1,8

"very very bad experience with flipkart seller.i am a seller the order as ready to dispatch but no one picking up the order even after 3 days. flipkart doing false reattempt marked the seller affected for bad score. this is the worst platform for a seller because every time you creat a ticket for the problem they will give you time and after time but your problem will never solved.amazon, messho and snapdeal logistics is a much much better from flipkart logistics so please don't waste time.",1,6

"flipkart is worst platform for seller. there seller claim process is totally fraud, they even dont provide claim for lost product of seller due to fault of flipkart or buyer. flipkart is also worst in return policy for seller, their policy says 7 days return period for customer but they approve returns above 50 days and deduct money from seller balance and refund amount to buyer without concent of seller. flipkart seller support team is worst and pathetic. meesho is far better is far better.",1,6

i would have rated zero. i have not seen worst service like this. i am trying to upload my documents but not able to do so due to some technical error from flipkart. i have raised lot of tickets from past 45 days for my issue but these people are closing the tickets without ressolving it. they do not pay any attention to your issues. their callback service is not working at all useless. by reading some of the rewiews i understood that flipkart is pathetic for sellers. better go for amazon,1,4

i could have rated zero if available. very worst experience and worst process they implement. every seller cannot become a manufacturer. they do not allow to sell the goods if you do not get authorization letter from your manufacturer for brand approval. fact is the indian manufacturers do not give such beurocratic dicuments. they are eager to make profits but they do not support after sales. none of my manufacturers or whole sellers give authorization letter. means i cannot sell on flipkart.,1,3

wrost service of flipkart if you are thinking of doing business with flipkart. then change your mind they lost my so many packets that i am in a loss of 15000 just because of flipkart. so don't sell with flipkart,1,3
here is the worst platform to do business. horrible customer base on this platform. it's the platform for illiterate customers. here u can sell non returnable product and still expect returns on them. i still want to use words which are unparliamentary. also flipkart sellers do not have better jobs other than packing. for this reason there are so many courier returns. the courier returns can average to 60% and customer returns can round up to 20% thus incurring huge losses.,1,3

one of the worst platform to sell which charges market place fee even for return orders. worst to the core,1,2
this is the worst platform for a seller because they don't pay any attention towards the issues a seller is facing. every time you create a ticket for the problem they will give you 5 days and after 5 days more 5 days and so on...but your problem will never get solved. they only run after marking the ticket as resolved which is actually never had been solved.,1,2

worst experience with flipkart. my orders not been picked. i continuously make tickets regarding pick up and false reattemp. stupid customer care just said we are looking but no one solved my problem and finally i have been wrongly charged for 350 rs. such a disgrace. never treat your first time sellers this way. it was our first order snd flipkart stopped our orders for 7 days. never faced this with amazon or elanic or spoyl. shameful and harassment.,1,6
fraud don't sell with flipkart the don't give payment correct. if you're a sellr so please consider every orders some order as sexcussfully delivery but the don't give payment. how return packt but don't deliver. as per my conciliation in may or june if in a big loss almost 1.2 lak. when i rase a ticket the give unnecessary aur foolish reason. like your account is in negative. flipkart handle aur packet so so badly. every return receive in deadly bad condition that we cannot reuse.,1,6

i am a seller on flipkart. i am writing this on this platform because i am not happy with flipkarts seller support. my spf chaims are rejected by saying we have not provided enough information. one of the reasons for rejecting was image is not provided as flipkart has forgot they have set a condition that you can't raise and submit spf claim without images and they are rejecting submitted claim saying image is not provided. due to flipkarts irresponsible behavior i have lost 40000 of goods.,1,3

worst than pathetic service for sellers... more than 90% order return due to the fault of flipkart logistics ekart....and return will be delivered only after lots of calls to customer support and ekart... or there are many chances that return get lost. don't use flipkart they are simply cheating sellers.,1,10

pathetic experience. logistics guys denied to pick the parcel up saying that its not in his route. cant understand why you allowed us to sell the products when you cant provide services. even the pincode is of city. 2 orders are ready to be picked up from last 3 days but no one is concerned about customer as well as seller experience. i must say that amazon is far better than flipkart. will discontinue as a seller of flipkart.,1,10

untorablle returns by coustomer ! when people buy the product and just use it once and return it by non sense resons they dont facing any problem but the sellers on flipkart are facing much problem and insteas of making profit they are in lose as coustmer returns are high on flipkart and that used product is totally waste of seller and also seller has to pay the market place fee which is very higher for cooustmer returns and flipkart dont accpet seller's claim its very often time they accept ! i req flipkart to change thier return policy for coustomer or reduce the market place fee for coustomer's returns! worst experience of selling products on flipkart because of this reason !,1,4

like many other sellers i am also a victim of easy returns and spf joke.  to make flipkart more buyer friendly they have absolutely ignoring and damaging sellers.  buyers give absolutely rubbish reasons for returns and they are accepted. but to prove them wrong we have to do litte more than rocket science people order things without seeing specifications and then expect a life size product or gold quality in price of pennies. and flipkart welcome them and even promote their stupidity a seller unfriendly company overall,2,2

"the return policy and few more changes are so havoc, that they have just gone brutal in only thinking one sided abt hw to increase their own margins, without understanding the overall impact on business, soon they will start to face a situation like amazon and snapdeal where they few sellers comparatively and at higher prices to cover eportal stupid charges.. if they levy charges on us we will simply increase the price and ultimately customer / sale will suffer..",1,10

flipkart customer's are playing with the app. flipkart does not verify the customer details and take fake orders. flipkart charge sellers for returns but most of the  products are returned undelivered and in that case the sellers should charge flipkart or the sellers should be compensated. backend system is pathetic as compared to other market places. if this continues the seller should stop supplying products to flipkart.,1,10

flipkart keeps the power to accept all customer returns. due to that we cannot cancel fake/invalid/fraud returns. but when it comes to sharing loss. flipkart will share only maximum 40% and you would have to bear 60% loss even you were correct and send the right product. don't ever think to sell on flipkart. flipkart is fraudkart for sellers. spf is seller protection fool.,1,7

nobody can take sellers query seriuosly either not giving proper resolution by seller support team they guys just trying to fool all sellers . i lost my amount of 22 k just because mishandling by ekart of my orders. still not getting any resolution. return policy also very bad,1,6
"please add a feature where the order shows the payment mode, cod or prepaid, its does not show in the app. have to check seller portal every time for this.",4,6
this is a joke website. all joking and nothing is happening. all policies are fraudulent. and they are themselves clueless. another ask me bazaar in making.,1,6
works well,5,6
i have updated my details almost 2 months ago and till now they are just showing that the will verify it poor app ill never sell items on flipkart and tell my knows to never sell items on flipkart,1,6

return policy is too bad as many orders are returned and seller have to bear the charges...,3,6

"return rate is very high. it accepts return without checking whether it was products fault or the customer returning without any reason.... - rating for oly for that,  if that's solved then i would surely rate it +4 stars.",1,6
good,4,6
it's amazing the best,5,6
suffering a lot because of high return rate. as per new rate card courier charges are to be paid by seller in case of returns and seller do not have rights to define his own return policy. flipkart customer returns product without giving any reason.,1,6
its very gud,5,6
nicw,5,6
charges too much.. shipping wt is max times incorrect.. have to contact support for correction. support service is also not good..customer number is not provided..too much return on flipkart and heavy charges imposed on seller.. amazon is way better,2,6
like me..,3,6
"listing , payments ,return and spf seller support notification sign should b pointed",3,6
just dont cheat  your sellers  pathetic service.     charges what ever they like,1,6
they charge too much for returns. a normal seller with normal profit margins will always be in loss due to their return policy. and if anyone says he is profitable(obvioaly not big brands) they havent calculated their returns properly.,1,6

never purchase a phone from flipkart. placed an order for moto 3rd generation and it was not in  working condition . placed a replacement  on 28th may 2016 and they don't even bother to revert back . customer service guys are rude when u call them up. #sadexp.,1,6

"excellent portal i ever seend . but main prob is the weight charges issue, many times flipkart charge yoo much amout then we have to complaints... this cycle are running till we work....pls try to resolve it.",3,6
"fk is good app which sends a good qty of orders but the only prob is with their payments and settlement part.....many times wrong weight was charged and each and every time i have to complain then they refund the money., sometimes instead of crediting the amount they debit the amount then again file a complaint,  therefore always put your eye on payment section. secondly they don't provide customer number so from our end we cannot resolve the issue....so option left is only return from customers",4,6

the worest service provided to sellers. when customer raise return request flipkart dosent ask sellers like other emarket sites do before accepting return. i have been  facingthis issue from long time. customer raise return flipkart accepts and return the product. this can be sourt out if flipkart can ask seller and seller can resolve the issue. by doing this customer satisfaction will goes up and more customer will get full support as well. this will be win win situation for all.......,1,5
they want only big name in their portal,1,5

"high fees very difficult to sustain not sure if flipkart understands model across categories..e.g. there are products with cost margin 25%, to please flipkart and customer we have to give 10% discount, approx 12% to flipkart as commission and rest we spend efforts on listing products and do seva.  time consuming product listing. payments interface has to improved but better than other marketplace. plus points good seller support,  process oriented. positive framework.",4,5

far ahead from competitors and offer all features a seller want. all other marketplaces trying to made such kind of app by offering updates but still lack. the only thing i like about flipkart is they plan far ahead of future which other marketplaces lack. app downtime is the only issue.,5,5
guys never think about buying and selling on flipkart. marketplace is where buyers and sellers are equally treated but here in flipkart nobody cares about genuine sellers like us and notifies that we are fake sellers despite having a trademark products. customer support does not have a knowledge of trademark process. piece of junk is hired at this company. never listens to the issue and investigate it. simply tells that policy does not allow to investigate. only genuine sellers are targeted.,1,5

"as compared to the amazon & snapdeal app, flipkart stands low. probably, even shopclues can come up with a better app. maximum time, the app as well as the seller panel are out of order due to system error. already, sellers are fed up of their commission & shipping charges structure, but even after charging too much per order, they can't come up with an average system of working. below average performance!",1,3
"this is what kind of fraud flipkart is doing with sellers. on 15-10-2015 i received order (od304176420838746000) of 50 no. sandisk 8 gb class 4 memory card. as no individual buyer buy this much quantity, i send mail to flipkart for order verification (reference number: 151015-150958). on 17-10-2015 flipkart confirm to process the order as they found the order genuine. so i dispatched the item as per order received. on 09-11-15 i received courier return (rto) of same order (od304176420838746000); at time of delivery i found box was tempered and repacked, so i open packet in-front of delivery boy and found 50 no fake 16 gb memory card inside the box. as a process i call local e-kart branch supervisor and reported the same; he said to receive the product and mail to flipkart for the same. ahead to this when i not received any payment for other orders till 30-01-2016, i send new mail (reference number: 160131-003194) to know the issue and they reply that my balance is negative but actually it was around ₹8000 positive and as per my calculation it was right.  now situation is flipkart make negative balance ₹-64506.15 for spf claim (od304176420838746000).",1,3
it is the worst website for the seller. the condition in which the products come back is pathetic. there is no support from the website for the seller.. the pick my boys do not corporate at all. if you guys dont give as much importance to the sellers as you give to the customers you will not go far,1,3
